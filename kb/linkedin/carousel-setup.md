✅ Step 1: Choose Your Topic

A great carousel starts with a clear and compelling topic.

Ask yourself:

What is a pain point my audience has?
Can I break it down into simple steps or slides?
Do I have insights, data, or personal experience to add?

Examples:

“5 Resume Mistakes That Are Costing You Interviews”
“How I Grew My LinkedIn to 10k Followers in 6 Months”
“A Beginner’s Guide to ChatGPT for Professionals”

✅ Step 2: Write the Script
Your carousel should tell a mini story or deliver value slide-by-slide.

Use this simple structure:

Slide 1 – Hook: Capture attention with a bold headline.
Slide 2 – Problem: Call out a relatable challenge.
Slide 3 – Insight: Share data, trends, or experience.
Slide 4-6 – Value: Share steps, tips, or strategies.
Slide 7 – Action: Include a CTA (comment, like, download).
Slide 8 – Brand: Sign off with your name and what you do.

Tip: Keep each slide’s text concise—ideally under 30 words.

✅ Step 3: Design the Slides
You can design LinkedIn carousels using tools like:

Canva (easy-to-use templates)
Figma (for more advanced layout control)
PowerPoint or Google Slides (export as images)

Design tips:

Use LinkedIn’s recommended size: 1080 x 1350 px (4:5 ratio)
Use bold headings and clear fonts
Stick to your brand colours
Use icons or visuals to break up text

✅ Step 4: Export the Carousel
Once your design is complete:

Export your slides as individual PNG or JPG files
Combine them into a multi-page PDF file (this is how LinkedIn recognizes it as a carousel)

Tools for combining slides into a PDF:

Canva’s “Download as PDF” option
Smallpdf or Adobe Acrobat
Mac Preview or Windows Print-to-PDF

✅ Step 5: Post on LinkedIn
Go to LinkedIn and:

Click “Start a Post”
Choose the “Document” icon
Upload your PDF carousel
Add a compelling caption that introduces the value
Include hashtags, mentions, and a call to action

Bonus Tip: Add a short hook in your caption that matches the first slide’s headline for consistency.

✅ Step 6: Engage With Your Audience
After publishing:

Reply to comments
Encourage shares or saves
Reshare your post with a new caption after a few days

Best Practices for Carousel Posts
Slide Count: Aim for 5 to 10 slides. Posts with fewer than 5 slides may see a 35% decrease in reach, while those exceeding 20 slides can experience a 25% drop in engagement. 
Slide Content: Keep each slide concise, with 25–50 words. Short, punchy content performs 30% better than text-heavy slides. 
Design: Utilise a vertical layout, which yields a 20% higher reach compared to square or horizontal formats. Stick to a clean, branded design using no more than three colours. o
Posting Time: Weekdays, especially Tuesdays and Thursdays between 8:00 and 10:30 AM, are optimal for posting.
