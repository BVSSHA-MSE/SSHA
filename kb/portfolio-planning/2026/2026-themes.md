# 2026 Themes
**Date:** 2025-12-21  
**Level:** Portfolio  
**Year:** 2026  
**Status:** In Progress — Outcome Discovery Complete

## Theme Mapping (Nested Structure)

### Portfolio → Theme 3: Compounding Value Over Time
*Artifacts reinforcing each other to create multi-year impact*

**Primary Constraint:** Isolated artifacts don't compound; value depends on sustained individual memory.

**Items:**
- Advocacy compounds over time
- Artifacts reinforce each other
- Learning transfers to others without re-explanation
- Create reusable sense-making
- Primary constraint shifted from "starting" to "compounding"
- Content accumulation without intentional coherence
- Advocacy effort feels cumulative, not repetitive
- Multi-year relevance and citation

---

### Program → Theme 1: Coherence & Navigation
*Making advocacy findable, connectable, and reusable*

**Primary Constraint:** Theme-making happens too late; navigation is reactive, not structural.

**Items:**
- Advocacy risks becoming locally useful but globally opaque
- Artifacts exist but navigation is challenging
- Sense-making fades without synthesis
- Reuse depends on memory or rediscovery
- Themes emerge only after significant work (decoupled discovery)
- Community value requires quick, safe orientation
- Establish coherent advocacy themes (2–3 named upfront)
- Explicitly link artifacts to themes
- Artifact trails showing evolution
- Periodic lightweight synthesis (quarterly)

---

### Team → Theme 2: Sustainable Momentum Through Variability
*Maintaining direction when energy and resolution vary*

**Primary Constraint:** Momentum requires consistent high energy; no graceful degradation model.

**Items:**
- Maintain sustainable practice through variable energy states
- Risk of momentum collapse during low-energy periods
- VRA model defined but not yet codified in practice
- Resolution varies; direction does not
- Energy ∝ fidelity (not output quality)
- Codify VRA with outcome log and resolution dial language
- Outcome log as single standing artifact
- Guardrails: never require high resolution to continue

---

## Observation: Nested Enablement

**Theme 1** (Coherence) + **Theme 2** (VRA) → enable **Theme 3** (Compounding)

- Option 2 (Program) addresses Theme 1
- Option 1 (Team) addresses Theme 2
- Portfolio outcome integrates all three

---

## Next Steps

- Continue with Step 1.3 Theme Selection (Portfolio = Theme 3)
- Draft candidate target outcomes
- Proceed through Steps 2–5 of outcome mapping workflow
