# Outcome Mapping Session — Leaders Seeking Sustainable Work Engage with SSH Advocacy

**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Level:** Portfolio  
**Year:** 2026  
**Theme:** Reach (new theme proposal; exception logged)  
**Status:** Mapping complete; ready for BVSSH facilitation handoff

---

## Session Summary

Facilitated outcome mapping for 2026 Portfolio outcome focused on getting SSH advocacy ideas to external leaders/practitioners seeking sustainable work alternatives. Starting from zero published pieces; outcome measures engagement (comments, shares, citations, questions) as signal of discovery and resonance.

---

## Step 0 — Year, Level & Theme

**Year:** 2026  
**Level:** Portfolio  
**Theme:** Reach (new theme proposal)

**Theme Rationale:**
- Outcome focuses on external reach and engagement (getting SSH ideas to practitioners)
- Different from Coherence (internal advocacy structure enabling reuse)
- Proposes new theme: "Reach" or "Advocacy Distribution"
- Logged as exception for theme evolution review

---

## Step 1 — Outcome Discovery (5-Dimension Capture)

### 1.1 Stream of Consciousness

**Goals:**
- Produce 6+ SSH advocacy pieces
- Get pieces to burnt-out practitioners
- Generate engagement/conversation (not just views)

**Context:**
- Starting from zero (no pieces published yet)
- Audience exists (burnt-out practitioners on blogs/LinkedIn)
- Production + distribution both needed; production upstream constraint

**Pains:**
- SSH ideas staying internal (not getting out)
- Burnt-out practitioners not finding SSH vocabulary/frameworks
- Risk: pieces produced but don't reach right people
- Risk: "publish and disappear" pattern repeats

**Questions:**
- What counts as successful engagement per piece?
- How do we know which pieces to produce first?
- How quickly do we learn what resonates?
- Should we produce all 6 then distribute, or produce → test → iterate?

**Ideas:**
- 3 topic clusters (Happier/Sooner/Better) guide production
- Measure production velocity AND engagement
- Advocates own production + engagement (not just writing)
- Start with Happier-focused (highest audience appeal)

### 1.2 Thematic Grouping

**Emerging Themes:**
1. Production Capacity — Getting pieces written/published
2. Reach & Engagement — Getting pieces to the right people
3. Learning Velocity — Discovering what resonates, iterating

### 1.3 Theme Selection

**Selected:** Advocacy Impact (end-to-end)
- Portfolio measures final impact (engagement)
- Program owns reach
- Team owns production
- Clearest separation of concerns

### 1.4 Candidate Target Outcomes

**Selected Candidate:** "Leaders Seeking Sustainable Work Engage with SSH Advocacy"
- **Rationale:** Leaders need SSH to apply it; practitioners already doing it; anyone can be a leader
- **BVSSH:** Happier (primary), Sooner (secondary), Better (clarity)

## Step 2 — Target Outcome Definition (SMART + Constraint)

**Final Target Outcome:**
> "Leaders Seeking Sustainable Work Engage with SSH Advocacy via Comments, Shares, Citations, and Questions Throughout 2026"

### SMART + Flow Engineering Breakdown

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Specific** | Leaders engage through 4 behaviors: read+comment, share+discuss in networks, reference/cite in their work, ask follow-up questions |
| **Measurable** | Engagement rate = (comments + shares + citations + questions) / views; tracked per piece and aggregated quarterly |
| **Achievable** | Assumes 6+ pieces published (owned by Program/Team); Portfolio measures engagement outcomes |
| **Relevant** | Addresses discovery constraint: leaders don't know SSH vocabulary/frameworks exist; engagement = discovery success |
| **Time-bound** | Quarterly reviews (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 2026); cumulative trend over year |
| **Stretch/Learning** | Learn: Which BVSSH dimension (Happier/Sooner/Better) generates highest engagement? Informs future piece prioritization |
| **Trade-offs (Explicit)** | Other advocacy channels (podcasts, conferences, workshops) not explored; content depth reduced in favor of breadth/reach |
| **Constraint Assumption** | Production + distribution owned by Program/Team; Portfolio focuses on engagement outcomes |
| **Behavioral Observable** | **Stops:** Leaders staying silent, toiling without SSH language. **Starts:** Commenting on pieces, sharing in networks, citing in their work, asking questions |
| **Flow Metric** | Engagement rate per piece; conversation velocity (shares+citations trend); audience growth rate |

### Design Decisions

**1. Engagement Definition:**
- All behaviors matter: read+comment, share+discuss, reference/cite, ask questions
- Not just "views" — passive reading doesn't count as success

**2. Time-Bound:**
- Quarterly reviews (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 2026)
- Cumulative trend tracking over full year

**3. Trade-offs:**
- Other advocacy channels not explored (podcasts, conferences, workshops)
- Content depth reduced in favor of reach/breadth

**4. Production Assumption:**
- Program/Team own production and distribution
- Portfolio measures engagement outcomes only

## Step 3 — Benefits Clarification

**Why This Outcome Matters:**

**Value (Awareness → Action):**
- Leaders engaging = awareness + caring enough to act (first critical step)
- Engagement signals readiness; silence signals toil continues unaddressed

**Risk (Burnout Cascade):**
If leaders stay silent and don't engage with SSH:
- Toil persists for leaders + their teams
- Burnout spreads, creating cascade across BVSSH dimensions:
  - **Better:** Lower quality work
  - **Value:** Left on table (unrealized potential)
  - **Sooner:** Quality ↓ → Speed ↓ (compounding delay)
  - **Safer:** Apathy → safety risks
  - **Happier:** Burnout persists and spreads to others

**Opportunity (Amplification):**
- Engaged leaders → potential future advocates (recruiting multiplier)
- Engagement → higher adoption (conversations lead to application)
- Engagement → viral spread (views expand from shares; reach compounds beyond any single advocate)

**BVSSH Rationale:**
- **Happier (primary):** Legitimizes pain; "work doesn't have to feel this hard" alleviates isolation
- **Sooner (secondary):** Faster discovery shortens time-to-relief; reduces delay before change starts
- **Better (clarity):** Naming toil reframes problem from "we're broken" to "system is broken" (actionable insight)

---

## Step 4 — Obstacles Identification

### Primary Constraints (Portfolio-Relevant)

**1. Discovery Constraint (Upstream for Portfolio):**
- Leaders don't yet have SSH vocabulary → can't search for what they don't know exists
- Pain naming must resonate before vocabulary helps
- Channel reach is limited (low follower count initially)
- **Hypothesis:** Naming pain first, then vocabulary, enables discovery

**2. Resonance/Engagement Constraint (Portfolio Core):**
- Historical pattern: writing doesn't generate engagement
- Unknown: What makes leaders comment/share/cite vs. read passively?
- Unknown: Which BVSSH dimension (Happier/Sooner/Better) drives engagement?
- Unknown: Timing (immediate vs. delayed engagement)?
- **Hypothesis:** One dimension resonates more; we'll learn from engagement patterns

**3. Production Constraint (Assumed Solved by Program/Team):**
- No pieces exist yet; BVSSH outcomes undefined
- Blocker: Can't measure engagement without pieces
- **Dependency:** Program/Team must deliver 6+ pieces + distribution
- **Portfolio assumes:** Production happens; we measure engagement outcomes

### Dependencies

- ✓ Program/Team deliver 6+ pieces by 2026
- ✓ Distribution channels (LinkedIn, blogs) remain viable
- ✓ Leaders have time/space to engage (not just passive reading)
- ✓ Pieces are discoverable (visibility via channels/algorithms)

### Uncertainties (Learning Opportunities)

- Which BVSSH dimension resonates most? (Happier hypothesis = primary)
- What drives engagement? (Pain naming? Vocabulary? Story format?)
- When do leaders engage? (Immediate? Weeks later? After multiple exposures?)
- Why do some engage and others stay silent? (Trust? Relevance? Timing?)

**Key Insight:** Portfolio outcome is measuring unknowns (resonance, engagement drivers). This is appropriate for Portfolio — we're learning what works, not prescribing solutions.

## Step 5 — Next Steps (Smallest Credible Actions)

### Actions (Next 2–4 Weeks)

**1. Audit SSH Conversation Locations (Week 1-2):**
- Scan LinkedIn, blogs, communities for where SSH/sustainable work conversations already happen
- Identify: Which channels? Which influencers/voices? Which pain points surface most?
- **Output:** Channel map + pain language patterns

**2. Test Pain Hooks on Small Audience (Week 2-3):**
- Draft 3 pain-naming hooks (Happier/Sooner/Better)
- Post on LinkedIn/blog as small test (not full piece)
- Measure: Which generates most engagement (comments, shares, saves)?
- **Output:** Validated hook(s); early signal on BVSSH dimension resonance

**3. Confirm Analytics Baseline (Week 1):**
- Verify LinkedIn + blog analytics track: views (impressions), engagement (reactions, comments, shares)
- Define threshold: What counts as "successful engagement"? (e.g., ≥X% engagement rate?)
- **Output:** Measurement framework ready for when pieces publish

**4. Complete Program/Team Outcome Definition (Week 3-4):**
- After Portfolio outcome documented, facilitate Program outcome
- Then facilitate 3 Team outcomes (topic clusters)
- **Output:** Full outcome hierarchy enabling production + distribution

## Target Audience Context

**Who:** Anyone seeking change, knows something is broken, looking for SSH (but doesn't have vocabulary yet). Toiling without realizing it's toil.

**Common Segments:**
- Agile/delivery practitioners hitting team-pace limits
- Engineering leaders managing burnout
- Product managers in constant churn
- Operations teams in firefighting
- Team leads drowning in overhead
- Directors noticing teams slowdown despite hiring

**Where they find us:** Blogs, LinkedIn

**BVSSH Hooks (Ranked by Segment Appeal):**

| Dimension | Hook | Why It Works |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Happier (Primary)** | "Work doesn't have to feel this hard"; sustainable teams still ship | Speaks to pain they're living |
| **Sooner (Secondary)** | "Feedback loops could be tighter"; value delivery accelerates | Connects to their frustration |
| **Safer (Validation)** | "Quality doesn't come from heroics"; resilience from design | Reframes effort as problem |
| **Better (Clarity)** | "There's a name/framework for this"; we're not broken, system is | Legitimizes their instinct |
| **Value (Long-term)** | Business case emerges after they believe change is possible | Later-stage hook |

## Decisions & Key Insights

**1. Advocacy is Output; Engagement is Outcome:**
- 6 pieces are the strategy, not the outcome
- Success = practitioners find, read, discuss, build on the ideas

**2. Don't Measure Adoption; Measure Exposure & Discourse Shift:**
- Can track: views, comments, shares, follows, citation patterns
- Can't track: whether they actually changed practices (not our job)

**3. Engagement ≠ Agreement:**
- Comments (critical or supportive) = success signal
- Silence = failure signal

**4. Distribution & Production are Separate Outcomes:**
- Program: how we reach them
- Team: what we say & how well it resonates

---

## Open Questions for Future Facilitation

1. **Engagement Threshold:** What counts as successful engagement per piece?
   - (e.g., ≥1000 views? ≥5 comments? ≥10 shares? All of above?)

2. **Ownership Model:** Should each advocate own an outcome, or shared ownership per topic?
   - Affects motivation, accountability, and collaboration patterns

3. **Piece Format:** Prescriptive (do this) or narrative (here's what happened)?
   - Happier works best with stories
   - Sooner/Better work with both
   - Shapes resonance measurement

4. **Feedback Loop:** How quickly do we learn which pieces work?
   - Weekly? Monthly? Per piece or in batch?
