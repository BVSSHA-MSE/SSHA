| Element | Learning Focus | Outcome Signal | Cadence |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| 1. Uncertainty Before Solutioning | Make uncertainty, assumptions, and boundaries explicit before acting | We pause long enough to explore intent before committing | Jan–Feb |
| 2. Outcome Quality Signals | Make "good outcomes" discussable, observable, and challengeable | We make better decisions earlier, with fewer reversals | Mar–Apr |
| 3. Low-Friction Discovery | Lower the cost of exploring outcomes without trivializing them | We experience less resistance to discovery over time | May–Jun |
| 4. Discovery that Compounds | Show how outcome discovery strengthens other ways of working | Our learning travels beyond individual conversations | Jul–Aug |
| 5. Outcome-First as Default | Observe unprompted outcome-oriented behavior | We start with outcomes without being reminded | Sep–Oct |
| 6. Outcome Discovery Sustained | Package validated learning for reuse without dogma | Our advocacy becomes lighter and more durable | Nov–Dec |
