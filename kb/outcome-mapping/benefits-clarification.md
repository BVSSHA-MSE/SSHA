# Benefits Clarification

Third step of Flow Engineering's Outcome Mapping phase. Makes explicit why the target outcome matters to ensure shared conviction and sustained focus.

## Purpose
Clarify why the target outcome matters—beyond gut feel—considering impacts to team, value stream, and stakeholders (internal and external).

## Core Benefits Dimensions

| Dimension | Guiding Questions |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Value Stream Impact** | How does this accelerate/improve flow through the stream? Does it unlock the constraint? |
| **Team Impact** | Does this reduce toil, improve safety, increase autonomy, or restore motivation? |
| **Internal Stakeholders** | Who inside the org benefits? (Product, Ops, Security, Finance, Leadership) |
| **External Stakeholders** | How do customers/partners/regulators experience the change? |
| **Risk Mitigation** | What bad outcome does this prevent? (outages, compliance failures, attrition) |
| **Economic Impact** | Revenue protected/gained? Cost avoided/reduced? Opportunity cost addressed? |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Does this enable broader goals? (platform scalability, market entry, capability building) |
| **Learning & Capability** | What new capability does the org gain? What becomes possible next? |

## Additional Dimensions to Consider

### 1. Time-Based Benefits
- **Sooner:** Faster feedback loops, reduced lead time, quicker decisions
- **Sustained:** Long-term resilience vs. one-time wins
- **Avoiding Future Pain:** Preventing technical debt, process debt, organizational drag

### 2. Flow Metrics Improvement
- Throughput (items completed per week)
- Lead time (idea → customer value)
- WIP reduction (fewer things in flight)
- Cycle time predictability (less variance)

### 3. Constraint-Specific Benefits
- **If approval is constraint:** Autonomy increases, decision latency drops
- **If handoffs are constraint:** Cross-functional collaboration improves
- **If testing is constraint:** Quality feedback accelerates

### 4. Cultural/Organizational Health
- Psychological safety improves
- Trust between teams strengthens
- Burnout risk decreases
- Retention improves

### 5. Visibility & Decision-Making
- Better signals for prioritization
- Reduced rework from misalignment
- Faster course correction

### 6. Ecosystem/Downstream Effects
- Enables other teams to move faster
- Reduces dependency blockers for adjacent streams
- Creates reusable patterns/capabilities

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Instead |
|---------|-----------|
| Generic benefits ("improve efficiency") | Specific, measurable impact ("reduce approval wait from 5 days → 24hrs") |
| Benefits unrelated to outcome | Tie every benefit explicitly to the target outcome |
| Only economic benefits | Balance flow, people, risk, and learning benefits |
| Ignoring trade-offs | Name what gets worse or deprioritized |

## Output: Benefits Summary

Capture 3–5 key benefits in this format:

**Benefit Name:** `<Who/What>` + `<Specific Impact>`  
**Dimension:** `<Value Stream | Team | Risk | Economic | Strategic | Learning>`  
**Evidence/Measure:** `<How we'll know this benefit materialized>`

## Example (from Target Outcome: "Reduce deployment approval cycle from 5 days → 24hrs")

| Benefit | Dimension | Evidence |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Deploy frequency increases 10×** | Value Stream Impact | ≥10 prod deploys/week (currently ~2) |
| **Security team stops being bottleneck** | Team Impact (Security) | Security spends <5hrs/week on approvals (currently 20hrs) |
| **Faster incident response** | Risk Mitigation | Hotfixes deployed <4hrs after fix identified |
| **Customer feature velocity improves** | External Stakeholder | Customer-visible features ship 3× faster |
| **Teams learn risk-based automation** | Learning & Capability | Automated risk classification becomes reusable pattern |

## Constraint Validation Check

**Critical question:** Do these benefits require unlocking the identified constraint?  
- If **no** → Wrong outcome or wrong constraint identified  
- If **yes** → Proceed with confidence
