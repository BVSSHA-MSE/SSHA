```
Portfolio (2026): Compounding Advocacy via Themes
  ↓ Enabled by
Program (2026): Quarterly Theme Synthesis Published [Active]
  ↓ Operationalized by
Team Outcome 1 (Weeks 1–2): Theme-Labeled Titles by Default [Active Jan 1]
  ↓ Prerequisite for
Team Outcome 2 (Weeks 3–4): Theme Trail Backlinks Automated [Planned Jan 15]

## Week 1 (Jan 1–14) — Outcome 1: Theme-Labeled Titles by Default

**What You'll Do:**
- Use template for all new artifacts (pre-fills `[Coherence] - ` tag)
- Confirm/override theme at creation (target: <30s decision lag)
- Log exceptions if artifact doesn't fit theme
- Track coverage weekly; aim for ≥95% by Jan 14

**Validation Checklist:**
- Filename has `[Coherence] -`?
- H1 header has `[Coherence] -`?
- Theme is correct?
- Exception logged if needed?

**Success:** ≥95% coverage by Jan 14 EOD

---

## Week 2 (Jan 15–28) — Outcome 2: Theme Trail Backlinks Automated

**Prerequisites:** Team Outcome 1 ≥95% coverage ✓

**What You'll Do:**
- Define backlink location: `kb/themes/coherence/index.md`
- Build/configure automation (AI-assisted script with your review)
- Run automation on each artifact publish
- Test accuracy; escalate if <80%
- Track synthesis prep time impact

**Daily Workflow:**
- Run automation on publish
- Spot-check first backlink(s)

**Weekly Review:**
- Log errors and accuracy %
- Assess lag time (target: <24h)
- Escalate if accuracy <80%

**Success:** ≥90% auto-backlinks; zero manual corrections by Jan 28 EOD

---

## Decision Points

**Jan 14 (End Week 1):**
- Team Outcome 1 ≥95%? → Proceed to Team Outcome 2 (Jan 15)
- Team Outcome 1 <95%? → Investigate exceptions; extend or iterate

**Jan 28 (End Week 2):**
- Team Outcome 2 ≥90% auto-backlinks? → Declare success; ready for Program synthesis
- Team Outcome 2 <90%? → Refine automation; extend by 1 week if needed

**March 31 (Q1 End):**
- Program: Publish first Coherence theme synthesis (planned, depends on Team successes)

## Contingencies

**If template is too much friction:**
- Simplify; reduce to <15 seconds to fill
- Move theme intent to separate "Theme Definitions" doc

**If theme is ambiguous:**
- Pause and add 1–2 line clarification to template
- Example: "Coherence = foundational SSH principles + outcome design thinking"

**If automation accuracy is low (<80%):**
- Document 3 worst misclassifications
- Adjust keyword logic or revert to keyword-only matching
- Escalation: Pause automation; don't force lower-quality backlinks

**If coverage stalls <95%:**
- Root cause: Forgotten template? Unclear theme? Friction in checklist?
- Remedy: Review exceptions; adjust guardrails; extend Week 1 if needed

---

## Success Looks Like

**By Jan 28:**
- New artifact = `[Coherence] - Title` (automatic, no thought)
- Backlinks appear in trail within 24 hours (automatic, no manual work)
- Exception log shows theme evolution signals (if any)
- Synthesis prep time trending toward zero (automation does the work)

**By March 31:**
- Program publishes first Coherence synthesis (curated, clear, reusable)
- Readers orient in <10 minutes via synthesis entry
- Reuse events increase (artifacts cited in new pieces)
- You have capacity for 6 significant SSH Advocacy pieces (not bogged in trail maintenance)
