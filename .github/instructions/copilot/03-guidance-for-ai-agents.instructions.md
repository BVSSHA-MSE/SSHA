# Guidance for AI Agents

- **Clarify requirements**: For any code generation, ask the user for the intended language, framework, and high-level goals.
- **Scaffold from scratch**: If implementing features, be prepared to create all necessary project structure, including source, test, and configuration files.
- **Document assumptions**: Clearly comment on any assumptions made about architecture, workflows, or conventions.
- **Reference standards**: In the absence of project-specific conventions, follow best practices for the chosen language/framework.
- **Respect the intent**: Prioritize learning, experimentation, and contribution over rigid structure or prescription.
- **Follow commit message policy**: All commit messages must strictly follow the Conventional Commits 1.0.0 format as documented in `CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md` at the repository root.
- **Update this file**: When new patterns, workflows, or conventions are established, update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to reflect them.
