# SSH Advocacy Embedded Portfolio-Wide

## Context
Currently, we are not performing from outcomes but from activity, which prevents us from practicing what we are advocating and compromises our integrity.

## Desired Outcome

### Better
Portfolio decisions and investment choices explicitly framed in outcomes-with-why; decision-makers can state desired change and rationale in under 2 minutes.

### Value
Every portfolio item tied to 1–2 clear outcomes; activity-only proposals rejected at intake.

### Sooner
Portfolio proposals surface outcome gaps at intake, not mid-execution; faster investment decisions.

### Safer
Integrity risk eliminated—external advocacy matches internal practice; zero "we say outcomes, do activities" exceptions in portfolio governance.

### Happier
Decision-makers have clarity on strategic intent; reduced cognitive load from aligning advocacy messaging with actual practice.

**Primary dimensions:** Safer (integrity/credibility), Value (strategic alignment over activity)
**Supporting:** Better (decision quality), Sooner (faster investment cycles), Happier (strategic clarity)

**Enabled by:**
- [Program: Easier to Drive Change with BVSSH Outcomes](../program/easier-to-drive-change-with-bvssh-outcomes.md)
- [Team: Outcome-First Becomes Default Through Automation](../team/outcome-first-default-through-automation.md)

## Hypothesis
We believe that requiring outcome-first framing in all portfolio proposals and governing through a BVSSH lens (enabled by Program adoption ease and Team automation),
Will result in eliminated integrity risk and improved investment decision quality—zero activity-only approvals, advocacy messaging matches practice.
We believe this because when the Program makes outcomes easy and the Team automates quality, portfolio governance can enforce outcome-first without friction, eliminating the "we say outcomes, do activities" contradiction.

## Expected Behavioral Change

### Before
Approving portfolio items based on activity descriptions; advocacy messaging disconnected from internal practice.

### Stop
- Approving proposals that lack outcome articulation
- Accepting "improve X" as sufficient outcome framing
- External advocacy claims that contradict internal portfolio decisions

### Start
- Rejecting activity-only proposals at intake (before investment)
- Opening portfolio reviews with "what outcome does this enable?" as first question
- Aligning external advocacy messages with portfolio governance practices

### After
Portfolio decisions require outcome articulation; investment approvals explicitly reference outcomes; advocacy messaging reflects our practice.

## Signals & Measures

### Leading
- Median specificity score of outcome statements (e.g., 1–5 rubric: 1=vague aspiration, 5=clear hypothesis + primary dimension)
- % of proposals where hypothesis connects action to expected behavioral change (avoid circular logic)
- % of portfolio proposals that state desired behavioral change before listing activities (trend: increase)

### Lagging
- % of active portfolio items with articulated outcome + aligned behaviors in practice (trend up = integrity improving)
- % of active portfolio items where we can articulate both what outcome we're pursuing AND why in <2 minutes (trend: increase)
- Instances of mid-execution strategy/activity pivots due to outcome misalignment (trend: decrease)

## Constraints & Guardrails

- **Time/income link unclear:** Trade-off - focus portfolio on high-impact work; accept slower expansion.
- **Passion can put people off:** Trade-off - balance advocacy intensity with listening and pragmatism.
- **AI dependency + own thinking:** Trade-off - use AI for speed/drafts, but own validation and reasoning.

## Review Cadence
Quarterly review with AI partner incorporates learning from active Program outcome reviews (e.g., adoption metrics, friction points, hypothesis adjustments).

### Decision points:

- **Continue:** Leading and lagging signals trending in expected direction (or holding steady).
- **Adjust hypothesis:** Signals flat/mixed; hypothesis may need refinement or behavioral changes need reset.
- **Pivot:** Signals trending opposite to expectation; underlying assumption invalidated; new approach needed.
