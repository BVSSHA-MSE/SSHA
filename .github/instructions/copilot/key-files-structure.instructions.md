# Key Files & Structure

- The repository contains:
	- `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md`, and `GROUND_RULES.md` at the root.
	- Content is organized in numbered directories under `ssha/` (e.g., `00-annual-advocacy/`, `99-archive/`) to support incremental, non-disruptive growth.
	- Additional top-level directories: `docs/`, `kb/`, and `playground/` for documentation, knowledge base, and experimentation.
- This is a documentation-first workspace: no source code, configuration, or build/test scripts are present at this time.
- The repository documents its strict Conventional Commits 1.0.0 commit message policy in `CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md` (see below).
- There are no other documented developer workflows, build systems, or test conventions at this time. Update this file if/when code or workflows are introduced.
