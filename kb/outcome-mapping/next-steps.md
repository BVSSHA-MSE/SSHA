# Next Steps (Outcome Mapping Step 5)

Fifth step of Flow Engineering's Outcome Mapping phase. Defines specific, time-bound actions to advance the target outcome.

## Guidance
- 3–7 specific, small, time-bound tasks tied to the target outcome.
- Format: `<Action> — Owner — Due date — Expected evidence/signal — Category`.
- Categories:
  - **Quick Wins:** Low effort, fast proof/relief.
  - **Foundational:** Enablers/infrastructure needed for progress.
  - **Learning:** Experiments/spikes to reduce uncertainty.
  - **Stakeholder Management:** Alignment, approvals, policy/decision paths.
- Scope bias: Unlock hypothesized constraint or de-risk key assumptions.
- Cadence: Weekly check-ins; track status (Not started / In progress / Blocked / Done); replan if blocked.
- Celebrate completion: Acknowledge wins to maintain momentum.
- Learning loop: Capture what was learned; decide to double down, pivot, or stop.

## Checklist Before Adding an Action
- Specific; completable in 1–2 weeks
- Clear owner and due date
- Observable evidence of completion
- Dependencies known; no hidden blockers
- Trade-off explicit (what we’re not doing)

## Example

| Action | Owner | Due | Evidence | Category |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pilot automated low-risk approvals on 1 service | Alice | Jan 15 | 5 prod deploys auto-approved, logs reviewed | Quick Win |
| Draft policy exception for low-risk changes | Bob | Jan 10 | Signed exception from Security/Legal | Stakeholder Management |
| Instrument approval lead time dashboard | Chen | Jan 12 | Dashboard shows p50/p90 cycle time daily | Foundational |
| Spike risk classifier accuracy on past 100 changes | Dee | Jan 18 | Accuracy ≥90% vs manual labels | Learning |
