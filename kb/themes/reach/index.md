# Reach Theme Trail

**Purpose:** Central entry point for Reach theme artifacts. Organize and navigate artifacts exploring external SSH advocacy reach, engagement, and distribution mechanisms to burnt-out change-seekers.

**Active:** 2026  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-26

## Theme Intent

**Reach:** External engagement, audience development, and distribution mechanisms that get SSH ideas to practitioners seeking sustainable work alternatives.

**Scope & Core Concepts:**
- SSH advocacy production and distribution to external audiences
- Engagement measurement (comments, shares, citations, questions)
- Discovery mechanisms (pain naming, vocabulary development, channel selection)
- Resonance testing (which BVSSH dimensions drive engagement)
- Audience growth and viral spread patterns

**Why it matters:** SSH ideas staying internal don't help burnt-out practitioners. Reach converts SSH thinking into accessible advocacy that finds leaders where they are, legitimizes their pain, and enables discovery of sustainable work alternatives.

## Artifacts by Level

### Portfolio
Foundation-level outcomes defining reach strategy and engagement measurement.

- [Leaders Engage with SSH Advocacy](../../../bvssh/2026/portfolio/reach-leaders-engage-ssh-advocacy.md) — Leaders seeking sustainable work engage via comments, shares, citations, questions; validate resonance and drive amplification (2026).

### Program
*(To be defined: distribution coordination, reach measurement, resonance learning)*

### Team
*(To be defined: production outcomes by BVSSH topic cluster — Happier/Sooner/Better)*

## Orientation Guide

### New to Reach? Start Here
1. **What is Reach in SSH advocacy?**  
   Read: [Leaders Engage with SSH Advocacy](../../../bvssh/2026/portfolio/reach-leaders-engage-ssh-advocacy.md) (Portfolio outcome; 8 min read)

2. **Who is the audience?**  
   Context: Burnt-out leaders, practitioners, teams seeking change without SSH vocabulary yet. See [Session Notes](../../../kb/outcome-mapping/sessions/20251226-reach-leaders-engage-ssh-advocacy.md) for audience segments.

3. **How do we measure engagement?**  
   Signals: Comments, shares, citations, questions tracked per piece and aggregated quarterly.

### Deepening Understanding
- **Explore BVSSH hooks:** See framing doc for dimension-specific pain hooks (Happier primary, Sooner secondary)
- **Understand discovery constraint:** Leaders can't search for what they don't know exists; pain naming precedes vocabulary
- **Track resonance:** Which dimension (Happier/Sooner/Better) drives highest engagement? Learn from patterns.

---

## Emerging Patterns

### Hypothesis Evolution
- **2026 Q1:** Test pain-naming hooks on small audience; validate Happier hypothesis as primary engagement driver
- **2026 Q2–Q4:** Measure engagement patterns; refine topic clusters; optimize for viral spread

### Dependencies
- Production + distribution owned by Program/Team
- Portfolio measures engagement outcomes
- No pieces exist yet; starting from zero

### Leading Questions
- Which BVSSH dimension resonates most with burnt-out leaders?
- What makes leaders engage (comment/share/cite) vs. read passively?
- When do leaders engage? Immediate or delayed?
- How does channel reach compound (follower growth → reach → engagement)?

---

## Gaps & Next Steps

### Open Questions
- **Program outcome:** How to coordinate distribution and reach across pieces?
- **Team outcomes:** Should advocates own pieces individually or by topic cluster (Happier/Sooner/Better)?
- **Engagement threshold:** What counts as successful engagement per piece? (≥1000 views? ≥10 comments?)

### Upcoming Milestones
| Date | Outcome | Success Criteria |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Q1 2026 | Portfolio outcome active | Audit SSH channels; test hooks; define analytics baseline |
| Q2 2026 | First pieces published | Measure engagement rate per piece; validate Happier hypothesis |
| Q4 2026 | 6+ pieces published | Cumulative engagement trending ↑; audience growth compounding |
