# Quality Checklist

- Confirms scope: year + level; single target outcome.
- Defines BVSSH: ≥3 non-generic dimensions across Better, Value, Sooner, Safer, Happier.
- Clarifies benefits: why it matters; risks/opportunities.
- Lists obstacles: constraints and dependencies; avoid blame.
- Next steps: smallest credible actions within weeks; tie to primary constraint.
- Hypothesis: smallest change → expected BVSSH effect → rationale.
- Behaviors: Before/After and Stops/Starts; observable only.
- Signals: 1–3 leading, 1–3 lagging; trend-focused and lightweight.
- Guardrails: explicit constraints and trade-offs; no placeholders.
- Cadence: review frequency, participants, and the decision the review enables.
- Reflection: surprises; validated/invalidated assumptions; what to adjust next time.
