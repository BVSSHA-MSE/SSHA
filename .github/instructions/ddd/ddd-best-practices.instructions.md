# DDD Best Practices (Ruby)

- Model behavior, not just structure.
- Keep aggregates small, prefer value objects.
- Enforce invariants.
- Organize code by feature/subdomain.
- Keep domain layer pure (no Rails/ORM dependencies).
- Use ports/adapters (hexagonal).
- Test domain logic thoroughly.
- Refactor as understanding grows.
