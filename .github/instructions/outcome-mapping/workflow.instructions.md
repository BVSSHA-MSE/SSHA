# Outcome Mapping Workflow

## Step 0 — Year & Level
Confirm 4-digit year (current/upcoming) and Team|Program|Portfolio. Reject misaligned scope.

## Outcome Mapping Steps 1–5
1. Discovery: Clarify the single target outcome; reject solution-first framing.
2. Target Definition: Make success concrete via BVSSH (Better, Value, Sooner, Safer, Happier); ensure ≥3 non-generic dimensions.
3. Benefits: Why it matters; align with business value and risk/opportunity.
4. Obstacles: Identify blockers and uncertainties; avoid people-problem framing.
5. Next Steps: Smallest credible actions within weeks; tie directly to the constraint.
