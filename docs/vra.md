# Variable-Resolution Advocacy (VRA)
**A Humane Operating Model for Outcome-Led BVSSH Advocacy**

## Purpose
Maintain **outcome integrity over time** by continuously sensing, learning, and sharing—without requiring constant energy, certainty, or production.

Advocacy is treated as a **sensing system**, not a content pipeline.

---

## Core Principle
**Resolution varies; direction does not.**

The system is always running.  
What changes is **fidelity**, not intent.

---

## The Three Adjustable Dials

The system adapts by moving three dials—independently and continuously.

1. **Resolution** — How detailed the thinking is  
   - Low: fragments, tensions, questions  
   - High: synthesized insights, patterns, narratives  

2. **Expression** — How externally visible the work is  
   - Low: private notes, internal logs  
   - High: shared artefacts, community contributions  

3. **Commitment** — How much future obligation is created  
   - Low: open-ended learning, no promises  
   - High: explicit hypotheses, next steps, reuse  

Any dial position is valid. No "mode switching" is required.

## The Single Standing Artefact: Outcome Log

A **living log** that preserves continuity across all energy states.

Each entry answers only what is true *now*:

- **Outcome or tension in play**
- **What changed (if anything)**
- **What remains unclear**
- **Decision taken, avoided, or deferred**
- *(Optional, private)* **Energy note**

Entries may be one line or several.  
Empty periods are acceptable if nothing changed.

---

## Outcome Mapping as Lenses (Not Stages)

Outcome Mapping phases are **lenses** applied when useful—not steps to complete.

| Lens | Typical Trigger |
|-----|-----------------|
| Outcome Discovery | Confusion increases |
| Target Outcome Definition | Decisions stall |
| Benefits Clarification | Resistance emerges |
| Obstacles Identification | Momentum drops |
| Next Steps | Energy rises |
| Reuse / Distillation | Patterns repeat |

Movement is non-linear. Re-entry is always allowed.

---

## How Significant Advocacy Emerges

Significant pieces are **resolution increases**, not new work.

They occur when:
- Multiple log entries cluster around the same tension
- Language stabilizes naturally
- Trade-offs become nameable

At that moment:
- Temporarily raise **Resolution**
- Optionally raise **Expression**
- Briefly raise **Commitment**

Then allow all dials to drift back down.

---

## Guardrails (to keep the system humane)

- Never require high resolution to continue  
- Never require publication to count  
- Never require certainty to speak  
- Never confuse silence with absence of learning  

If any guardrail is violated, the system has become brittle.

---

## BVSSH Outcome Alignment

- **Better:** Clearer thinking, fewer reversals  
- **Value:** Outcomes anchored in real tensions  
- **Sooner:** Reduced restart and recovery cycles  
- **Safer:** Lower reputational risk  
- **Happier:** Sustainable advocacy without pressure  

---

## Definition of Success

> Advocacy continues **without collapse**,  
> learning remains **inspectable**,  
> and significant contributions **emerge naturally** over time.
