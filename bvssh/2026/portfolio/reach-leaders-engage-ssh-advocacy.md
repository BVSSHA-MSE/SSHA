# [Reach] - Leaders Engage with SSH Advocacy
**Year:** 2026  
**Level:** Portfolio  
**Theme:** Reach  
**Status:** Active (starting Q1; first quarterly review March 31)

---

## 1) Year & Level
- **Year:** 2026
- **Level:** Portfolio

## 2) Outcome Name & Theme
- **Theme:** Reach
- **Outcome Name (3–7 words):** Leaders Engage with SSH Advocacy

## 3) Context & Tension
- **Current state:** No SSH advocacy pieces published yet; SSH ideas stay internal; leaders lack access to SSH vocabulary and frameworks.
- **Observable tension:** Leaders toiling without realizing it's toil; no external SSH presence to legitimize their pain or enable discovery of sustainable work alternatives; production is upstream constraint (can't measure engagement without pieces).
- **Why now:** Burnout cascade risk across BVSSH dimensions (Better, Value, Sooner, Safer, Happier); engagement enables amplification (reach, recruiting advocates, higher adoption); 2026 is year to establish compounding external SSH advocacy reach.
- **Parent link:** Assumes Program/Team deliver production + distribution; Portfolio measures engagement outcomes to validate resonance and guide future piece prioritization.

## 4) Desired Outcome (BVSSH)
- **Primary dimensions:** Happier, Sooner
- **Happier:** Leaders discover SSH ideas legitimizing their pain; "work doesn't have to feel this hard" alleviates isolation; sustainable work becomes visible alternative.
- **Sooner:** Faster discovery shortens time-to-relief; leaders engage within days/weeks of publish (not months); learning cycles compress (test hooks → validate dimension → refine next piece).
- **Secondary:** Better, Value, Safer
- **Better:** Naming toil reframes problem from "we're broken" to "system is broken" (actionable insight); clear SSH vocabulary enables conversation.
- **Value:** Engagement signals readiness for change; capacity freed as engaged leaders become advocates (recruiting multiplier); viral spread compounds reach beyond single advocate.
- **Safer:** Prevents burnout cascade; apathy → safety risks reduced; engagement ≠ agreement (critical comments = success signal vs. silence = failure).

## 5) Outcome Hypothesis
- **Hypothesis:** Publishing 6+ SSH advocacy pieces — and measuring engagement via comments, shares, citations, questions — will validate which BVSSH dimension (Happier/Sooner/Better) resonates most with leaders facing challenging work environments, because engagement patterns reveal discovery mechanisms and enable future piece optimization for reach.

## 6) Expected Behavioral Change (observable)
- **Before:** SSH ideas stay internal; no external advocacy pieces; leaders stay silent, toiling without SSH language; no conversation or engagement.
- **After:** 6+ pieces published by Q4 2026; leaders comment on pieces, share in networks, cite in their work, ask follow-up questions; engagement rate tracked quarterly; dimension resonance validated.
- **Stops:** "Publish and disappear" pattern; writing without engagement measurement; assuming adoption without tracking conversation; ignoring silence as failure signal.
- **Starts:** Publishing advocacy pieces by BVSSH topic cluster (Happier/Sooner/Better); tracking engagement rate per piece (comments + shares + citations + questions / views); quarterly resonance reviews; testing pain hooks on small audiences before full pieces; auditing SSH conversation locations; refining pieces based on engagement patterns.

## 7) Signals & Measures (trends over targets)
- **Leading (1–3):**
  - Hook resonance: engagement rate on small-audience tests (comments, shares, saves) per BVSSH dimension (trend: identify highest-resonance dimension by Q2).
  - Channel discovery: % of target audience segments represented in engagement (trend: ↑ toward balanced coverage across practitioners/leaders/directors).
  - Piece-to-engagement lag: median days from publish to first engagement (comment/share/citation) (trend: ↓ toward <7 days).
- **Lagging (1–3):**
  - Engagement rate: (comments + shares + citations + questions) / views per piece, aggregated quarterly (trend: ↑ toward ≥5%; baseline established Q1).
  - Conversation velocity: shares + citations per piece per month (trend: ↑; validates reach hypothesis).
  - Audience growth: follower count on LinkedIn + blog subscribers (trend: ↑; enables compounding reach).

## 8) Constraints & Guardrails
- **Constraints:** Production + distribution owned by Program/Team (Portfolio assumes pieces exist); limit to 6+ pieces in 2026 (depth vs. breadth trade-off); channels limited to LinkedIn + blogs initially (defer podcasts, conferences, workshops).
- **Trade-offs:** Content depth reduced in favor of reach/breadth; other advocacy channels not explored in 2026; engagement measurement over adoption tracking (can't measure if they change practices, only if they engage).
- **Guardrails:** Engagement ≠ agreement (critical comments = success); silence = failure signal (no conversation = no impact); quarterly resonance reviews required (don't wait until year-end to learn); test hooks before full pieces (reduce waste); audit SSH channels in Week 1–2 (validate LinkedIn assumption); define analytics baseline in Week 1 (views, comments, shares trackable).

## 9) Review & Learning Cadence
- **Weekly (Weeks 1–4):** Audit SSH channels (Week 1–2); test pain hooks (Week 2–3); confirm analytics baseline (Week 1); track first engagement signals.
- **Quarterly reviews (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 2026):** Aggregate engagement rate per piece; validate BVSSH dimension resonance (Happier hypothesis); decide piece prioritization for next quarter; assess audience growth and conversation velocity; refine hooks and formats based on engagement patterns.
- **Participants:** Self (quarterly synthesis); optional: 1–2 external practitioners for engagement spot-check (do hooks resonate? why/why not?).
- **Decision enabled:** Which BVSSH dimension to prioritize for next quarter? Which topic cluster (Happier/Sooner/Better) generates highest engagement? Should we expand channels or deepen LinkedIn/blog presence? When does engagement justify recruiting engaged leaders as future advocates?

## 10) Reflection (post-outcome)
- **Capture:** Which BVSSH dimension resonated most (Happier hypothesis validated/invalidated)? What drove engagement vs. silence? When did leaders engage (immediate vs. delayed)? What surprised us about resonance patterns? Did viral spread compound as expected? Which pieces recruited future advocates? What format/tone/length worked best? What to change for 2027?

## Outcome-Specific Definitions

### Engagement Definition
**Four Observable Behaviors:**
1. **Read + Comment:** Leaders leave comments (critical or supportive) on pieces
2. **Share + Discuss:** Leaders share pieces in their networks (LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack) and discuss with peers
3. **Reference/Cite:** Leaders cite SSH ideas or pieces in their own work (blogs, presentations, conversations)
4. **Ask Questions:** Leaders ask follow-up questions (comments, DMs, email) exploring SSH concepts further

**Not Engagement:** Passive views, likes without comments, bookmarks without shares, silent reading.

### Engagement Rate Formula
**Calculation:** `(comments + shares + citations + questions) / views`  
**Tracked:** Per piece and aggregated quarterly  
**Baseline:** Established Q1 2026 (expect low initially; trend ↑ over year)  
**Target:** ≥5% by Q4 (directional; prefer trend over fixed target)

### BVSSH Topic Clusters (Team-Level Production)
**Happier-Focused (Primary Hypothesis):**
- Pain hook: "Work doesn't have to feel this hard"
- Audience: Burnt-out leaders, teams drowning in overhead
- Format: Narrative/story (legitimizes pain, shows sustainable teams still ship)

**Sooner-Focused (Secondary):**
- Pain hook: "Feedback loops could be tighter"
- Audience: Delivery practitioners, Agile/engineering leaders
- Format: Prescriptive or narrative (faster learning, decision speed)

**Better-Focused (Clarity):**
- Pain hook: "There's a name for this toil"
- Audience: Change-seekers, directors noticing slowdown
- Format: Framework/vocabulary (system-level insight, not people blame)

### Audience Segments
**Who:** Anyone seeking change, knows something is broken, looking for SSH (but doesn't have vocabulary yet). Toiling without realizing it's toil.

**Common Segments:**
- Agile/delivery practitioners hitting team-pace limits
- Engineering leaders managing burnout
- Product managers in constant churn
- Operations teams in firefighting
- Team leads drowning in overhead
- Directors noticing teams slowdown despite hiring

**Where they find us:** Blogs, LinkedIn (primary channels 2026)

### Burnout Cascade (Risk Model)
If leaders stay silent and don't engage with SSH, toil persists → burnout spreads across BVSSH dimensions:
- **Better:** Lower quality work (shortcuts, technical debt)
- **Value:** Left on table (unrealized potential, missed opportunities)
- **Sooner:** Quality ↓ → Speed ↓ (compounding delay, rework cycles)
- **Safer:** Apathy → safety risks (ignored warnings, corner-cutting)
- **Happier:** Burnout persists and spreads to others (cascade effect)

### Amplification Mechanisms (Opportunity Model)
- **Engaged leaders → future advocates:** Recruiting multiplier (1 piece → 10 engaged leaders → 2 become advocates → compound reach)
- **Engagement → higher adoption:** Conversations lead to application (comments surface questions → answers enable action)
- **Viral spread:** Views expand from shares; reach compounds beyond any single advocate (network effects)

### Analytics Baseline (Week 1)
**Confirm LinkedIn + blog analytics track:**
- **Views:** Impressions per piece
- **Engagement:** Reactions, comments, shares (LinkedIn); comments, social shares (blog)
- **Citations:** Manual tracking (search for piece title/SSH terms in external content)
- **Questions:** DMs, emails, comment threads

**Threshold Question (Open):** What counts as "successful engagement" per piece? (e.g., ≥1000 views? ≥10 comments? ≥5% engagement rate?) Decision deferred to Q1 baseline.

### Discovery Constraint & Hypothesis
**Problem:** Leaders don't yet have SSH vocabulary → can't search for what they don't know exists.  
**Hypothesis:** Naming pain first (Happier hooks), then vocabulary (Better frameworks), enables discovery.  
**Test:** Audit SSH conversation locations (Week 1–2); test pain hooks on small audience (Week 2–3); measure which hook drives highest engagement.

### Resonance Uncertainty (Core Learning)
**Unknowns (Portfolio is measuring these):**
- Which BVSSH dimension (Happier/Sooner/Better) resonates most?
- What makes leaders comment/share/cite vs. read passively?
- When do leaders engage? (Immediate? Weeks later? After multiple exposures?)
- Why do some engage and others stay silent? (Trust? Relevance? Timing?)

**Hypothesis:** Happier dimension resonates most (speaks to pain they're living); Sooner secondary (connects to frustration); Better validates (legitimizes instinct).

## Next Steps (Q1 2026, Weeks 1–4)

### Week 1–2: Audit SSH Conversation Locations
- **Action:** Scan LinkedIn, blogs, communities for where SSH/sustainable work conversations already happen
- **Output:** Channel map + pain language patterns (which terms/hooks surface most?)
- **Decision:** Validate LinkedIn assumption or pivot channels

### Week 2–3: Test Pain Hooks on Small Audience
- **Action:** Draft 3 pain-naming hooks (Happier/Sooner/Better); post on LinkedIn/blog as small test (not full piece)
- **Output:** Validated hook(s); early signal on BVSSH dimension resonance (which generates most comments/shares/saves?)
- **Decision:** Prioritize Happier-focused pieces if hypothesis validated

### Week 1: Confirm Analytics Baseline
- **Action:** Verify LinkedIn + blog analytics track views, engagement (reactions, comments, shares)
- **Output:** Measurement framework ready; baseline engagement rate captured
- **Decision:** Define "successful engagement" threshold per piece

### Week 3–4: Define Program/Team Outcomes
- **Action:** Facilitate Program outcome (distribution coordination); then 3 Team outcomes (topic clusters: Happier/Sooner/Better)
- **Output:** Full outcome hierarchy enabling production + distribution
- **Decision:** Who owns which pieces? Individual advocates or shared by topic cluster?
