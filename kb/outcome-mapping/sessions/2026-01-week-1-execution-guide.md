## Pre-Week 1 Checklist (Before Jan 1)

- [ ] Review artifact template: `kb/themes/coherence/artifact-template.md`
- [ ] Copy template locally for quick access (or bookmark path)
- [ ] Open exceptions log: `kb/outcome-mapping/sessions/theme-exceptions-2026-01.md`
- [ ] Create a checklist in your editor/workspace for "Publish Validation" (see below)
- [ ] Set a weekly sync reminder (e.g., Friday EOD) to log coverage %

## Daily Workflow (Jan 1–14)

### When Creating a New Artifact
1. Copy template: `kb/themes/coherence/artifact-template.md`
2. Fill in title: Replace `[Artifact Title]` with your title
3. Theme is pre-filled: `[Coherence] - [Your Title]`
4. Confirm theme is correct; override if needed (log exception if different theme)
5. Write content
6. Before publishing: **Validate theme in title and filename**

### Publish Validation Checklist
**Before committing artifact, check:**
- [ ] Filename includes `[Coherence] -`?
- [ ] H1 header includes `[Coherence] -`?
- [ ] Theme is correct for this artifact (else log exception)?
- [ ] If exception, entry added to `theme-exceptions-2026-01.md`?

## Weekly Sync (Friday EOD)

**Count and log:**
- Total new artifacts created this week: ___
- Artifacts with `[Coherence] -` tag: ___
- Coverage %: ___ / ___ = ___%
- Tag omission incidents: ___
- Theme mismatch incidents: ___
- Template adoption: Did I use the template for all? (Yes/No)
- Decision: Are we on track for ≥95% by Week 2? (Yes/No)

**Log in:** `kb/outcome-mapping/sessions/2026-01-week-1-coverage.md` (create if needed)

---

## Escalation

**If any of these happen:**
- Coverage falls below 85%: Investigate why; is template frictionless? Is theme unclear?
- Template adoption <100%: Did I skip it as a "quick shortcut"? Recommit.
- Theme mismatch incidents >1: Theme definitions may need clarification.

---

## Week 1 Success Criteria

By Friday, Jan 10:
- [ ] ≥3 artifacts created using template
- [ ] Coverage ≥75% (early snapshot, not final goal)
- [ ] Zero "forgot to tag" moments (prevented by template)
- [ ] Exception log shows any theme clarifications needed

---

## Week 2 Execution (Jan 8–14)

Same workflow; measure final coverage by Jan 14 EOD.

**Week 2 Final Checklist:**
- [ ] Final coverage % ≥95%
- [ ] Tag omission incidents = 0
- [ ] Exception log complete
- [ ] Decision: Proceed to Outcome 2? (Must have ≥95% coverage)

---

## Files to Monitor

- **Template:** `kb/themes/coherence/artifact-template.md` (current artifact starter)
- **Exceptions:** `kb/outcome-mapping/sessions/theme-exceptions-2026-01.md` (weekly review)
- **Coverage log:** `kb/outcome-mapping/sessions/2026-01-week-1-coverage.md` (create and update weekly)

---

## If Things Go Wrong

- **Template is too much friction:** Simplify; template <15 seconds to fill.
- **Theme is ambiguous:** Add 1–2 line clarification to template intent section.
- **Exceptions pile up:** Pause and host a 30-min theme evolution conversation.
