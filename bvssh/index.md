# [Theme] - <Short, Meaningful Outcome Name>

**Year:** [YYYY]
**Theme:** [Theme]
**Status:** [Draft|Active|Achieved]

## 1. Context & Tension
What is happening today that makes this outcome necessary?

- Current situation:
- Observable pain, friction, risk, or missed opportunity:
- Why this matters *now*:

> Frame the tension as a system problem, not a people problem.

## 2. Desired Outcome (Better Value Sooner Safer Happier)
If this outcome is achieved, what will be *meaningfully different*?

### Better
- How quality, clarity, or effectiveness improves:
- What is less broken, less reworked, or more reliable:

### Value
- Who benefits (customer, user, team, organization):
- What becomes more aligned with real needs or intent:

### Sooner
- What becomes faster, simpler, or lower-friction:
- Where time-to-learning or time-to-value is reduced:

### Safer
- What risks are reduced or better managed:
- How confidence, resilience, or compliance improves:

### Happier
- How the human experience improves:
- What feels more sustainable, motivating, or humane:

## 3. Outcome Hypothesis (Data → Insight → Belief → Bet)

**We believe that**  
<The smallest credible change in behavior, decision-making, or system design>

**Will result in**  
<The outcome described above, expressed in BVSSH terms>

**Because**  
<The reasoning or insight connecting the change to the outcome>

## 4. Expected Behavioral Change
If this outcome is taking hold, what will people do *differently*?

- Before:
- After:
- What stops happening:
- What starts happening:

> Favor observable behaviors over activity or output.

## 5. Signals & Measures (Lightweight)
How will we know we’re heading in the right direction?

### Leading Signals (Early, imperfect)
- Signal 1:
- Signal 2:

### Lagging Signals (Later, more concrete)
- Signal 1:
- Signal 2:

> Prefer trends over targets. Signals should enable learning, not control.

## 6. Constraints & Guardrails
What must remain true while pursuing this outcome?

- Regulatory, ethical, or safety constraints:
- Capacity or cognitive load limits:
- Explicit trade-offs we are accepting:

---

## 7. Review & Learning Cadence
How and when will we inspect and adapt?

- Review frequency:
- Who participates:
- What decision this review enables:

---

## 8. Reflection (Written After the Work)
What did we learn by pursuing this outcome?

- What surprised us:
- What assumptions held or broke:
- What we would do differently next time:
