# DDD Core Philosophy (Ruby)

- **Domain First:** Model the business domain, not the database or framework.
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Use shared terms with domain experts in code.
- **Bounded Contexts:** Explicitly define where models/terms are valid.
- **Continuous Learning:** Refine models as understanding deepens.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Evolve code and language together.
