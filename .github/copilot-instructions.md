Anchor responses in [GROUND_RULES.md](../GROUND_RULES.md); stay concise and honest.

## Workspace Snapshot
- Documentation-first portfolio (Better Value Sooner Safer Happier) with numbered ssha directories and companion docs.
- Active Ruby experiments in playground: asciidoctor_doc_system and clean_architecture_experiment, each self-contained with specs in specs/.
