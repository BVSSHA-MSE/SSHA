# SSH Advocacy Reach 2026 — Outcome Framing & Structure

**Status:** Design (ready for outcome facilitation)  
**Context:** Defining Portfolio, Program, and Team outcomes to drive 6+ pieces of external SSH advocacy to burnt-out change-seekers

---

## Target Audience

**Who:** Anyone seeking change, knows something is broken, looking for SSH (but doesn't have vocabulary yet). Toiling without realizing it's toil.

**Common Segments:**
- Agile/delivery practitioners hitting team-pace limits
- Engineering leaders managing burnout
- Product managers in constant churn
- Operations teams in firefighting
- Team leads drowning in overhead
- Directors noticing teams slowdown despite hiring

**Where they find us:** Blogs, LinkedIn

## BVSSH Hooks (Ranked by Segment Appeal)

| Dimension | Hook | Why It Works |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Happier (Primary)** | "Work doesn't have to feel this hard"; sustainable teams still ship | Speaks to pain they're living |
| **Sooner (Secondary)** | "Feedback loops could be tighter"; value delivery accelerates | Connects to their frustration |
| **Safer (Validation)** | "Quality doesn't come from heroics"; resilience from design | Reframes effort as problem |
| **Better (Clarity)** | "There's a name/framework for this"; we're not broken, system is | Legitimizes their instinct |
| **Value (Long-term)** | Business case emerges after they believe change is possible | Later-stage hook |

## Three-Level Outcome Structure

### Portfolio Outcome
**"Leaders Seeking Sustainable Work Engage with SSH Advocacy"**

- **Audience:** Leaders, practitioners, teams actively seeking alternatives to burnout and unsustainable pace
- **Engagement Signal:** Leaders interact with SSH advocacy pieces—reading, discussing, sharing, asking questions, exploring ideas
- **BVSSH Focus:** Happier (primary: sustainable work is possible) + Sooner (secondary: faster feedback/learning) + Better (clarity: approach to thinking differently)
- **What We're Producing:** 6+ pieces of SSH advocacy that help practitioners understand and engage with SSH thinking about sustainable work
- **Measurement:** Views, comments, shares, follow-ups, citation patterns; engagement rate by BVSSH dimension (Happier content > others)

### Program Outcome
**"SSH Advocacy Reaches Burnt-Out Practitioners & Generates Conversation"**

- **Role:** Coordinate distribution, reach, resonance across advocate pieces
- **BVSSH Focus:** Sooner (faster discovery) + Happier (accessible tone) + Better (clarity)
- **Behavioral Change:** Advocates shift from "publish and disappear" → "publish, engage, listen, iterate"
- **Measurement:** Reach trend (views, impressions, audience growth); engagement rate per piece; audience segment clarity

### Team Outcomes
**Option B (Recommended): Topic Cluster**
- "Happier-Focused Advocacy (Sustainable Teams, Respecting People) Reaches & Resonates with Burnt-Out Leaders"
- "Sooner-Focused Advocacy (Feedback Loops, Decision Speed) Reaches & Resonates with Delivery Practitioners"
- "Better-Focused Advocacy (Frameworks, Naming Toil) Reaches & Resonates with Change-Seekers"

**Advantages:**
- Aligns piece creation with audience preference
- Enables collaboration by theme
- Guides which pieces matter most (measure by segment engagement)
- 3 outcomes instead of 6, more manageable

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Advocacy is output; engagement is outcome**
   - 6 pieces are the strategy, not the outcome
   - Success = practitioners find, read, discuss, build on the ideas

2. **Don't measure adoption; measure exposure & discourse shift**
   - Can track: views, comments, shares, follows, citation patterns
   - Can't track: whether they actually changed practices (not our job)

3. **Engagement ≠ agreement**
   - Comments (critical or supportive) = success signal
   - Silence = failure signal

4. **Distribution & production are separate outcomes**
   - Program: how we reach them
   - Team: what we say & how well it resonates

---

## Open Questions for Facilitation

1. **Engagement Threshold:** What counts as successful engagement per piece?
   - (e.g., ≥1000 views? ≥5 comments? ≥10 shares? All of above?)

2. **Ownership Model:** Should each advocate own an outcome, or shared ownership per topic?
   - Affects motivation, accountability, and collaboration patterns

3. **Piece Format:** Prescriptive (do this) or narrative (here's what happened)?
   - Happier works best with stories
   - Sooner/Better work with both
   - Shapes resonance measurement

4. **Feedback Loop:** How quickly do we learn which pieces work?
   - Weekly? Monthly? Per piece or in batch?

## Next Steps

1. Facilitate Portfolio outcome via BVSSH nine-step
2. Facilitate Program outcome
3. Facilitate 3 Team outcomes (one per topic cluster)
4. Map pieces to Team outcomes
5. Define engagement thresholds & measurement cadence
