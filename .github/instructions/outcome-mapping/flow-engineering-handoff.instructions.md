# Flow Engineering Handoff

- From Outcome Mapping → Current State VSM: select the value stream delivering the outcome; map end-to-end; identify the primary constraint.
- Dependency Mapping: expose influences and causes; avoid premature solutions.
- Future State VSM: design for smoother, faster flow; define future-state measures.
- Flow Roadmapping: prioritize by impact/effort; sequence Now/Next/Later; assign owners and success measures; aim for executable actions within weeks.
