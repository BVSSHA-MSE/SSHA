# Annual SSH Advocacy

This repository is a long-lived personal advocacy and learning portfolio aligned with Better Value Sooner Safer Happier principles.

It captures learning, experimentation, reflection, and contribution over time.
Content ranges from raw notes to polished outputs.

The intent is learning and contribution, not prescription.

Numbered directories are intentionally spaced to allow future expansion without structural disruption.
