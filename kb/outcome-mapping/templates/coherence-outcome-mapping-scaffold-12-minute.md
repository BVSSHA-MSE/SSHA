# [Coherence] - Outcome Mapping Scaffold (12-Minute)

**Year:** 2025  
**Theme:** Coherence  
**Type:** Facilitation Kit  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Quick Instructions (≤12 minutes)
- Set a 12-minute timer; stop when it rings.
- Use plain language; avoid solution-first framing.
- Require: named primary constraint + ≥3 BVSSH signals.

---

## 1) Year & Level
- Year: [YYYY]
- Level: [Team | Program | Portfolio]

## 2) Outcome Name
- 3–7 words; outcome-focused; avoid activity verbs.
- Format: [Theme] - [Outcome Name]

## 3) Context & Tension
- Current state (observable).  
- Pain/risk/opportunity; why now.

## 4) Desired Outcome (BVSSH)
Capture concrete end-states (≥3 dimensions):
- Better:
- Value:
- Sooner:
- Safer:
- Happier:

## 5) Outcome Hypothesis
Smallest credible change → expected BVSSH effect → because/rationale.

## 6) Expected Behavioral Change
- Before/After (observable behaviors only).  
- Stops/Starts.

## 7) Signals & Measures (trends over targets)
- Leading (1–3):
- Lagging (1–3):

## 8) Constraints & Guardrails
- Real constraints; explicit trade-offs.  
- Guardrails; avoid generic placeholders.

## 9) Review & Learning Cadence
- Frequency; participants; decision enabled.

## 10) Reflection (post-outcome)
- Surprises; validated/invalidated assumptions; next changes.

## Checklist (Complete Before Facilitation)
- Named primary constraint present.
- ≥3 BVSSH signals defined (lean; observable). 
- Behaviors are observable (not sentiments). 
- Signals prefer trends, not fixed targets.
- Time box respected (≤12 minutes).
