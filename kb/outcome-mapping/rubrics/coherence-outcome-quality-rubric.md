# [Coherence] - Outcome Quality Rubric (Draft)

**Year:** 2025  
**Theme:** Coherence  
**Type:** Policy Brief / Rubric  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose
Lightweight scoring (1–5) to assess outcome drafts produced via the 12-minute mapping scaffold. Target average ≥4.0/5.

---

## Criteria (Score 1–5 each)
- Constraint Clarity: Primary constraint is explicit, relevant, and testable.
- BVSSH Coverage: At least three dimensions have concrete end-states (non-generic).
- Signals Quality: Signals are observable, lightweight, and trend-based (1–3 leading, 1–3 lagging).
- Behaviors Observability: Before/After + Stops/Starts are observable behaviors, not sentiments.
- Hypothesis Coherence: Smallest credible change maps to BVSSH effects with a clear rationale.

---

## Scoring Guide
- 1: Missing or vague across most criteria; solution-first; signals absent.
- 2: Partial; constraint unclear; signals weak or target-only; behaviors vague.
- 3: Adequate; meets minimums (≥3 BVSSH, signals present) with moderate clarity.
- 4: Strong; clear constraint; good BVSSH coverage; signals and behaviors are observable.
- 5: Exemplary; concise, testable; signals are high-signal/low-effort; hypothesis tightly reasoned.

## Calculating the Score
- Total = sum of five criteria (max 25).  
- Average = Total / 5.  
- Target: Average ≥4.0/5.

## Notes
Use trends over targets; avoid vanity metrics. Keep measurement lightweight to encourage adoption and iteration.
