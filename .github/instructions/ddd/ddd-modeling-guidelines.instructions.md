# DDD Modeling Guidelines (Ruby)

- Use event storming, mapping, interviews to discover/refine models.
- Make implicit concepts explicit (e.g., status objects).
- Push behavior into domain objects.
- Extract value objects from primitives.
- Use domain events for temporal/inter-aggregate communication.
