# Outcome Discovery Process

First step of Flow Engineering's Outcome Mapping phase. Produces a collection of candidate target outcomes tied to a single theme.

## Process

### 1. Stream of Consciousness Capture
Participants surface items across 5 dimensions:

| Dimension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Goals** | What we want to achieve |
| **Context** | Current state, constraints, environment |
| **Pains** | Problems, risks, opportunities driving urgency |
| **Questions** | Uncertainties, unknowns, assumptions to test |
| **Ideas** | Potential solutions, approaches, interventions |

**Rule:** Items can appear in multiple dimensions (e.g., "slow deployments" = Pain + Context).

### 2. Thematic Grouping
- Cluster items into themes (emergent, not pre-defined)
- Look for patterns across dimensions
- Example themes: "delivery speed," "handoff friction," "approval bottlenecks"

### 3. Theme Selection
- Choose one theme to tackle for this outcome cycle
- Criteria: impact, urgency, constraint alignment

### 4. Draft Candidate Target Outcomes
- From the selected theme's items, draft 2–5 candidate target outcomes
- Use BVSSH lens (Better, Value, Sooner, Safer, Happier)
- Keep outcomes specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, relevant, and time-bound

### 5. Outcome Discovery Complete
- Collection of candidate target outcomes tied to one theme
- Proceed to Target Definition (refine/select final outcome)

## Key Insight
Separates divergent thinking (capture all dimensions) from convergent thinking (pick one theme, draft outcomes). The 5 dimensions provide structure without prescription.
