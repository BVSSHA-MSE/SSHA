# Validation Checks

- Challenge (❗️): people-problem framing; activity/output posing as outcome; vague or non-observable behaviors; hard targets over trend signals; circular hypotheses.
- Simplify (⚠️): multiple unrelated changes; excessive behaviors; more than five total signals; generic/placeholder guardrails.
- Iterate (🔄): uncertainty or contradictions; hypothesis misaligned with desired outcome; behaviors not tied to hypothesis.
