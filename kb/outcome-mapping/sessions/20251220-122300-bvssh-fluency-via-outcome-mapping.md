# Outcome Mapping Session — 2025 Team

Session: 20251220-141500
Theme: Build BVSSH fluency via lightweight Outcome Mapping preceding BVSSH facilitation
Scope: Year 2025, Level Team

## Step 1 — Outcome Discovery

Goals
- Build quality BVSSH outcomes as a key result
- Make outcome-first thinking habitual across the team
- Reduce cognitive load while improving outcome quality

Context
- Still validating BVSSH and what "high quality" means
- Current BVSSH automation is strong; discovery is manual and costly
- Proposed two-stage flow: Outcome Mapping → BVSSH Outcome Facilitation

Pains
- Manual mapping adds cognitive load; risk it won’t be adopted
- Outcomes can be shallow or solution-first without discovery
- Inconsistent signals and constraint alignment across outcomes

Questions
- Does discovery friction yield better outcomes measurably?
- Which signals define outcome "quality" for BVSSH?
- Can we design mapping to be low-friction (≤15 minutes) without losing rigor?

Ideas
- Lightweight mapping scaffold integrated into automation
- Quality rubric for BVSSH outcomes (constraint, signals, behaviors)
- A/B validate two-stage process vs. direct facilitation baseline

### Thematic Grouping
- Discovery rigor vs. cognitive load
- Habit formation: outcome-first by default
- Validation: two-stage process effectiveness

### Theme Selection
- Selected: Build team fluency in outcome-oriented thinking with low-friction mapping that measurably improves BVSSH outcome quality

### Candidate Target Outcomes (2–5)
1. Reduce mapping cognitive load to ≤12 minutes p50 while raising BVSSH outcome quality scores ≥4.0/5, with ≥80% sessions completed over 6 weeks.
2. Make outcome-first habitual: ≥90% team proposals start with a constraint-aligned target outcome that includes ≥3 BVSSH signals.
3. Validate two-stage efficacy: Mapping→Facilitation outcomes show 2× higher signal alignment vs. direct facilitation baseline over 4 weeks.
4. Publish 3 reusable mapping templates; adoption in ≥70% sessions; average formation time ≤12 minutes.

## Step 2 — Target Outcome Definition (SMART + Constraint)

Primary Constraint
- Cognitive load and lack of fluency in discovery cause low adoption and inconsistent outcome quality.

Target Outcome (SMART)
- Specific: Introduce a 12-minute, low-friction outcome mapping scaffold integrated with automation to make outcome-first habitual.
- Measurable: ≥85% proposals start with a constraint-aligned target outcome including ≥3 BVSSH signals; mapping p50 ≤12 minutes, p90 ≤20 minutes; quality score ≥4.0/5.
- Achievable: Leverages existing automation; adds lightweight scaffold + rubric; pilot-first.
- Relevant: Directly addresses the discovery constraint causing shallow outcomes.
- Time-bound: Validate within 6 weeks from start of pilot.

Target Outcome — Statement
- By the end of a 6-week pilot, make outcome-first habitual by adding a 12-minute outcome mapping scaffold integrated with automation, so that ≥85% team proposals begin with a constraint-aligned target outcome including ≥3 BVSSH signals; mapping cycle time p50 ≤12 minutes (p90 ≤20); outcome quality score ≥4.0/5.

Beyond SMART — Flow Engineering Additions
- Stretch + Learning: Learn how to detect and shape outcome quality via rubric and signals; design low-friction discovery that teams adopt.
- Trade-offs (Explicit): Optimize habit and speed over exhaustive documentation; fewer, clearer signals over long artifacts.
- Constraint Validation: Success requires reducing cognitive load in discovery; if adoption rises and quality improves, constraint moved.
- Behavioral Observable: Teams start with mapping scaffold; stop drafting activity lists first. Proposals include constraint, signals, behaviors.
- Flow Metric Alignment: Outcome formation cycle time; adoption rate; signal alignment quality; rework rate.

BVSSH Signals (≥3, non-generic)
- Better: Outcome quality score ≥4.0/5 using rubric (constraint named, ≥3 signals, observable behaviors).
- Sooner: Mapping cycle time p50 ≤12 min, p90 ≤20 min across sessions.
- Value: ≥85% proposals start with outcomes; rework on outcomes decreases ≥30%.
- Safer: Solution-first proposals drop to <10%; ≥90% outcomes name a primary constraint.
- Happier: Self-reported cognitive load decreases ≥20% via weekly check-in instrument.

## Step 3 — Benefits Clarification
- Value Stream Impact: Faster, clearer outcome formation enables quicker, aligned decisions; reduces rework.
- Team Impact: Lower cognitive load; outcome-first becomes habit; improved autonomy.
- Risk Mitigation: Guardrails reduce solution-first drift; consistent constraint alignment.
- Economic Impact: Less rework/time waste; faster iteration on advocacy initiatives.
- Learning & Capability: Team gains reusable patterns for constraint-first, BVSSH-aligned outcomes.

## Step 4 — Obstacles Identification
- Hypothesized Constraint: Discovery cognitive load; unclear quality signals.
- Dependency Risks: Need buy-in for rubric and adoption across contributors.
- Capability Gaps: Designing effective rubric; instrumenting measures.
- Political/Cultural: Resistance to changing proposal habits; skepticism of added step.
- Measurement Blind Spots: No current baseline for quality or cycle time.
- Competing Priorities: End-of-year bandwidth; advocacy deadlines.

## Step 5 — Next Steps (2–4 weeks)
1. Draft outcome quality rubric (constraint, ≥3 BVSSH signals, behaviors) — Owner: Facilitator — Due: 2025-12-27 — Evidence: rubric published; reviewed by 2 peers — Category: Foundational.
2. Scaffold a 12-minute mapping template (checklist + prompts) integrated with automation — Owner: Automation Lead — Due: 2026-01-03 — Evidence: template available in tooling; 3 test runs — Category: Quick Win.
3. Instrument metrics (cycle time, adoption %, quality score) — Owner: Ops/Analytics — Due: 2026-01-05 — Evidence: dashboard with weekly p50/p90, adoption, quality — Category: Foundational.
4. Pilot A/B over 4 weeks (Mapping→Facilitation vs. direct facilitation) — Owner: Facilitator — Start: 2026-01-06 — Evidence: comparative report; 2× signal alignment target — Category: Learning.
5. Micro-training (30 min) on constraint-first thinking + scaffold use — Owner: Advocacy Lead — Due: 2026-01-08 — Evidence: attendance + post-survey showing ≥20% load reduction — Category: Stakeholder Management.

## Decisions & Unresolved Questions
- Owners confirmed? If not, assign by 2025-12-22.
- Baseline quality and cycle time need initial measurement in week 0.
- Adoption threshold (≥85%) to be validated; adjust based on pilot learnings.

Handoff Prep: After pilot validation, proceed to BVSSH Outcome Facilitator to codify the outcome artifact and integrate rubric into the BVSSH process.
