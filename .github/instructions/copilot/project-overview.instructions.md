# Copilot Project Overview

- **Annual SSH Advocacy** is a personal, long-lived advocacy and learning portfolio aligned with Better Value Sooner Safer Happier principles.
- The repository captures learning, experimentation, reflection, and contribution over time, with content ranging from raw notes to polished outputs.
- The intent is learning and contribution, not prescription.
- Numbered directories are intentionally spaced to allow future expansion without structural disruption.
- The playground hosts Ruby-based Clean Architecture and DDD experiments (asciidoctor_doc_system, clean_architecture_experiment) that are self-contained with local specs.
- The knowledge base in kb/ captures concise agent notes and references; keep it organized by topic.
