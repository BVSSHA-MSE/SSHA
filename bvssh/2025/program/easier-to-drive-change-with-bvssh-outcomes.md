# Easier to Drive Change with BVSSH Outcomes

## Context
BVSSH outcome-driven change is hard when new. Making it the default now saves us from ongoing resistance from old habits. We are also error prone as humans.

**Enables Portfolio outcome:** [SSH Advocacy Embedded Portfolio-Wide](../portfolio/ssh-advocacy-embedded-portfolio-wide.md) by reducing friction in practicing BVSSH across all work.

## Desired Outcome

### Better
Outcome articulation becomes second-nature; contributors use BVSSH language without prompting.

### Value
Meaningful, business-aligned outcomes become the standard practice across all work intake.

### Sooner
Median outcome formation time ≤5 minutes; self-service success without intervention ≥90%.

### Safer
Adoption barriers removed; practice consistently applied without relying on individual memory or discipline.

### Happier
Zero friction in forming outcomes; contributors gain confidence in articulating outcomes; clear path from idea to aligned work without cognitive overhead.

**Primary dimensions:** Sooner (formation speed), Happier (friction removal)
**Supporting:** Better (habit formation), Value (meaningful outcomes), Safer (consistent practice)

**Enabled by:**
- [Team: Outcome-First Becomes Default Through Automation](../team/outcome-first-default-through-automation.md)
- [Team: Outcome Fluency Through Mapping](../team/outcome-fluency-through-mapping.md)

## Hypothesis
We believe that removing adoption friction through Team automation and making BVSSH the default approach to work intake
Will result in ≥90% self-service success, median formation time ≤5 minutes, and contributors naturally using BVSSH language—enabling Portfolio governance to enforce outcome-first without resistance.
We believe this because when automation removes cognitive overhead and prompts outcome-first thinking at work intake, practice becomes habitual rather than effortful, accelerating internalization and enabling portfolio-wide adoption.

### Risks & Assumptions
- **Assumes:** Friction (not understanding or motivation) is the primary barrier. If we don't value outcomes, ease alone won't help.
- **Risk:** Over-automation could reduce critical thinking—contributors may fill templates without genuine outcome reasoning.
- **Mitigation:** Quality review automation (Team) catches shallow outcomes; review cadence validates genuine understanding vs. compliance.

## Expected Behavioral Change

### Before
Jumping directly to tasks and activities without articulating outcomes.

### Stop
- Proposing work without outcome context
- Accepting vague "improve X" statements as outcomes

### Start
- Asking "what outcome are we trying to achieve?" during work intake and planning
- Asking "have we reached the outcome?" during reviews
- Asking "how can we measure our progress towards our outcome?" when forming outcomes
- Framing our work from the outcomes' perspective rather than simply output/task oriented

### After
Outcomes articulated before any work proposal; we naturally use BVSSH language without prompting
Examples: "Reduces median setup time (Sooner)" or "Closes hypothesis validation for Outcome XYZ with the following observations: ..."

## Signals & Measures

### Leading
- Median time to form a well-structured BVSSH outcome (trend: minutes)
- % of outcomes requiring manual rework after initial formation (trend: down)
- Self-service success rate for outcome formation without intervention (trend: up)

These leading indicators enable Portfolio outcome by accelerating adoption: as median formation time decreases and self-service success rises, % of Portfolio proposals articulating outcomes will trend up.

### Lagging
- Spot checks of recent commits (monthly samples) show increasing references to active outcomes in commit messages (trend: up).
- Quality scores from automated outcome reviews (trend: up)

## Constraints & Guardrails

- **Automation over manual:** Use this to drive review and quality analysis automation over manual activity.
- **Focus trade-off:** Will defer other automation (e.g., portfolio reporting dashboards, automated retrospective summaries) to focus here for ending 2025 well and bringing 2026 to a healthy and powerful start.

## Review Cadence
Every commit can consider active outcomes (see Lagging measure). Every team outcome completion triggers program review and bubbles up to portfolio review.
