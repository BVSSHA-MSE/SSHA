# 2026 Candidate Outcomes

Derived from 2025 outcome reflections and learnings. Organized by level.

---

## Portfolio Level

- **Portfolio Outcome Performance Validation (Portfolio):** Measure if portfolio outcomes are actually producing claimed behavioral change in practice (move beyond "outputs aligned" to "outcomes validated")
- **Portfolio Dependency Mapping (Portfolio):** Visualize how Portfolio ← Program ← Team outcomes chain together; enables clearer 2027 planning

---

## Program Level

- **Formation Time Instrumentation & Tracking (Program):** Move outcome formation from ~30-minute median to <5-minute target by instrumenting and trending formation time across team; foundation for Program adoption 2026
- **Monthly Spot Checks Formalization (Program):** Scheduled commit message sampling and quality score reviews (not ad-hoc)
- **Adoption Breadth Measurement (Program):** Track % of all work proposals with outcomes across Portfolio (not just Team-level); enables Portfolio outcome validation and breadth assessment
- **Advocacy Alignment Audit (Program):** Formalize quarterly audit ensuring external SSH advocacy claims remain traceable to active portfolio decisions
- **Learning Indexing & Archival (Program):** Define what gets indexed from kb/ for governance reference vs. session notes; create searchable archive of 2025 decisions and hypotheses

---

## Team Level

- **Commit Message Edge Case Handling (Team):** Robustify automation to handle unknown outcomes, multiple outcomes per commit, hallucination detection, and elaboration validation—mitigates risks flagged in outcome reflection
- **Automation Fallback & Resilience Documentation (Team):** Document and maintain local scripts/manual templates as fallback paths before automation becomes critical—mitigates GitHub/Copilot dependency risk
- **CI/CD Integration for Outcome Linking (Team):** Extend GitHub Copilot Workflows to CI/CD pipelines; validate outcomes before merge/deploy—deferred as out-of-scope for 2025
- **Mapping Scaffold Generalization (Team):** Extend the 12-minute outcome mapping scaffold beyond Coherence theme; test rubric and heuristics on domain-specific outcomes
- **Quality Rubric Continuous Refinement (Team):** Formalize monthly rubric review cadence; iterate scoring logic based on edge cases and false positives downstream
- **Outcome Status Tracking (Team):** Add explicit status field (Active/Completed/Paused) to templates and automation; enable outcome lifecycle visibility

---

## Cross-Cutting (System Maturity)

- **Portfolio-Level Reporting Automation (Team/Program):** Dashboard/export of active outcomes and trends for quarterly review

---

## Candidate Themes

### Primary Theme
**All 15 candidates naturally fit Coherence** — they strengthen outcome-first practices, deepen quality standards, and enable reuse and compounding across advocacy work.

### Secondary Theme Clusters
Candidates cluster around secondary themes that may become distinct in future years:

- **Governance** (5 candidates): Portfolio Dependency Mapping, Monthly Spot Checks Formalization, Adoption Breadth Measurement, Advocacy Alignment Audit, Outcome Status Tracking
  - *Insight:* Governance patterns (approval gates, lifecycle states, audit trails) emerge as critical operational infrastructure for outcome-first portfolio management.

- **Operations** (6 candidates): Formation Time Instrumentation & Tracking, Commit Message Edge Case Handling, Automation Fallback & Resilience Documentation, CI/CD Integration for Outcome Linking, Outcome Status Tracking, Portfolio-Level Reporting Automation
  - *Insight:* Operational resilience, measurement, and tooling maturity are blocking issues for scaling outcome-first practice; candidates suggest "Operations" may emerge as a 2027+ theme.

- **Measurement** (3 candidates): Portfolio Outcome Performance Validation, Adoption Breadth Measurement, Portfolio-Level Reporting Automation
  - *Insight:* Moving from "outputs aligned" to "outcomes validated" requires systematic measurement; candidates suggest measurement/validation may become a distinct theme.

- **Automation** (4 candidates): Commit Message Edge Case Handling, CI/CD Integration for Outcome Linking, Mapping Scaffold Generalization, Portfolio-Level Reporting Automation
  - *Insight:* Automation robustness and breadth (beyond current 2026 automation scope) is required to enable portfolio-wide adoption without toil.

### 2027+ Evolution Signals
If 3+ candidate outcomes from a secondary cluster move to active status in 2026, consider proposing a new theme for 2027 (e.g., **Operations**, **Governance**, **Measurement**). Current secondary clusters suggest operational infrastructure and measurement depth will become strategic priorities.
