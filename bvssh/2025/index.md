## 2026 Candidate Outcomes

### From Team Outcomes (Completed)

#### Team Level
- **Commit Message Edge Case Handling (Team):** Robustify automation to handle unknown outcomes, multiple outcomes per commit, hallucination detection, and elaboration validation—mitigates risks flagged in outcome reflection
- **Automation Fallback & Resilience Documentation (Team):** Document and maintain local scripts/manual templates as fallback paths before automation becomes critical—mitigates GitHub/Copilot dependency risk
- **CI/CD Integration for Outcome Linking (Team):** Extend GitHub Copilot Workflows to CI/CD pipelines; validate outcomes before merge/deploy—deferred as out-of-scope for 2025
- **Mapping Scaffold Generalization (Team):** Extend the 12-minute outcome mapping scaffold beyond Coherence theme; test rubric and heuristics on domain-specific outcomes
- **Quality Rubric Continuous Refinement (Team):** Formalize monthly rubric review cadence; iterate scoring logic based on edge cases and false positives downstream

#### Program Level
- **Formation Time Instrumentation & Tracking (Program):** Move outcome formation from ~30-minute median to <5-minute target by instrumenting and trending formation time across team; foundation for Program adoption 2026

### From Program Outcome (Completed)
- **Outcome Status Tracking (Team):** Add explicit status field (Active/Completed/Paused) to templates and automation; enable outcome lifecycle visibility
- **Monthly Spot Checks Formalization (Program):** Scheduled commit message sampling and quality score reviews (not ad-hoc)
- **Portfolio-Level Reporting Automation (Team/Program):** Dashboard/export of active outcomes and trends for quarterly review
- **Adoption Breadth Measurement (Program):** Track % of all work proposals with outcomes across Portfolio (not just Team-level); enables Portfolio outcome validation and breadth assessment

### From Portfolio Outcome (Completed)
- **Advocacy Alignment Audit (Program):** Formalize quarterly audit ensuring external SSH advocacy claims remain traceable to active portfolio decisions
- **Portfolio Outcome Performance Validation (Portfolio):** Measure if portfolio outcomes are actually producing claimed behavioral change in practice (move beyond "outputs aligned" to "outcomes validated")
- **Portfolio Dependency Mapping (Portfolio):** Visualize how Portfolio ← Program ← Team outcomes chain together; enables clearer 2027 planning

### Cross-Cutting (System Maturity)
- **Learning Indexing & Archival (Program):** Define what gets indexed from kb/ for governance reference vs. session notes; create searchable archive of 2025 decisions and hypotheses
