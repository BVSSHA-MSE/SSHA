# [Coherence] - Compounding Advocacy via Themes
**Year:** 2026  
**Level:** Portfolio  
**Theme:** Coherence  
**Status:** Finalized (Nine-Step BVSSH Outcome)

---

## 1) Year & Level
- **Year:** 2026
- **Level:** Portfolio

## 2) Outcome Name & Theme
- **Theme:** Coherence
- **Outcome Name (3–7 words):** Compounding Advocacy via Themes

## 3) Context & Tension
- **Current state:** Sustainable, outcome-led advocacy practice was established in 2025; artifacts exist but navigation is challenging; synthesis often happens late.
- **Observable tension:** Work risks becoming locally useful but globally opaque; reuse depends on memory or rediscovery; compounding is now the primary constraint.
- **Why now:** 2026 focus is structural coherence so artifacts reinforce each other, accelerate orientation, and enable reuse; supports producing **6 significant SSH Advocacy pieces** without cognitive overload.

## 4) Desired Outcome (BVSSH)
- **Better:** Theme-linked trails make learning inspectable; fewer reversals and clearer evolution of hypotheses.
- **Value:** Reuse and extension increase without re-explanation; artifacts become reusable assets and compound impact.
- **Sooner:** Orientation for readers drops under 10 minutes; faster dialogue and iteration across the portfolio.
- **Safer:** Lightweight synthesis prevents a stream from accumulation to chaos; theme stability reduces risk of category drift.
- **Happier:** Advocacy feels intentional and cumulative; humane practice that sustains energy variability; avoids burnout by reducing repetitive explanation.

## 5) Outcome Hypothesis
- **Hypothesis:** Declaring the theme at creation time using title-based linking — `[Coherence] - [Advocacy Artifact Title]` — will reduce orientation time and increase reuse, because theme coherence moves from post-hoc synthesis to a built-in, observable practice.

## 6) Expected Behavioral Change (observable)
- **Before:** Standalone artifacts; post-hoc theme synthesis; orientation depends on memory.
- **After:** Theme-labeled titles at creation; explicit trail linkage; reuse without re-explaining.
- **Stops:** Post-hoc theme tagging as the primary mechanism; memory-dependent discovery.
- **Starts:** Title-based theme declaration and consistent link to theme trails in kb.

## 7) Signals & Measures (trends over targets)
- **Leading (1–3):**
  - Theme linkage coverage: proportion of new artifacts using `[Coherence] - [Title]` pattern (trend toward full coverage).
  - Theme trail updates: count of explicit artifact-to-theme backlinks per month (trend up).
- **Lagging (1–3):**
  - Reader time-to-orientation (median minutes) trending down from baseline (<10 minutes).
  - Reduced start-from-scratch prep time when engaging new audiences (self-reported trend).
  - Reuse events: artifacts referenced/adapted/extended monthly (trend up).

## 8) Constraints & Guardrails
- **Constraints:** Theme naming must be lightweight and natural; no heavy taxonomy; keep themes to **2–3**.
- **Trade-offs:** Some flexibility is lost by pre-naming; allow reclassification with captured rationale in kb.
- **Guardrails:** Title-based linking only; avoid bureaucratic patterns; prefer trend signals over fixed targets; iterate themes quarterly if needed.

## 9) Review & Learning Cadence
- **Monthly check-in:** Review signals and friction; decide whether to adjust/keep theme names and title pattern.
- **Quarterly synthesis:** Publish one lightweight synthesis artifact; decide theme evolution and fill trail gaps.
- **Participants:** Self; optionally 1–2 practitioners/advocates for baseline feedback.
- **Decision enabled:** Keep/adjust themes and linking pattern; confirm artifact roadmap toward 6 significant pieces.

## 10) Reflection (post-outcome)
- **Capture:** Surprises; validated/invalidated assumptions; what to change next cycle.

## Theme-Linking Pattern
- **Chosen:** Title notation — `[Coherence] - [Advocacy Artifact Title]` (options like tag-based linking remain documented for future consideration).

## Orientation Time Baseline
- **Current:** Unknown

## What is a Reuse Event?
- **Definition:** An artifact is referenced, adapted, or extended in a new advocacy piece (tracked via backlinks or self-report).

## What is a Significant Piece of SSH Advocacy?
- **Definition:** An advocacy deliverable that meaningfully advances BVSSH dimensions, changes observable behaviors, or influences decision-making.

## Non-Exclusive Examples of Significant SSH Advocacy Pieces
 - Playbooks/Templates: checklists, canvases, and minimal scripts that enable default outcome-first behaviors.
 - Outcome Maps/Trails: linked maps that orient readers and connect artifacts across themes.
 - Case Studies: real narratives with signals, decisions, and learnings that others can adapt.
 - Reference Architectures/Models: visual models plus rationale that align decisions and reduce re-explanation.
 - Facilitation Kits: workshop agendas, exercises, and capture templates that produce reusable outputs.
 - Policy Briefs/Guardrails: lightweight governance patterns that nudge practices toward BVSSH outcomes.
 - Interactive Guides/Decision Aids: click-through tutorials or small tools that shorten orientation and enable reuse.
 - Infographics/Diagrams: high-clarity visuals that compress orientation time and expose hypotheses.
