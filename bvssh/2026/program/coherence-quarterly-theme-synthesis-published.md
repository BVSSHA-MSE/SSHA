# [Coherence] - Quarterly Theme Synthesis Published
**Year:** 2026  
**Level:** Program  
**Theme:** Coherence  
**Status:** Active (Operationalized by Team outcomes Weeks 1–4; first synthesis due March 31, Q1 end)

---

## 1) Year & Level
- **Year:** 2026
- **Level:** Program

## 2) Outcome Name & Theme
- **Theme:** Coherence
- **Outcome Name (3–7 words):** Quarterly Theme Synthesis Published

## 3) Context & Tension
- **Current state:** Theme-linked artifacts are growing; orientation relies on individual trails and memory; synthesis is ad hoc.
- **Observable tension:** Without a regular synthesis cadence, artifacts accumulate into opaque streams; reuse depends on rediscovery rather than curated entry points.
- **Why now:** Program-level cadence and format make coherence inspectable and reusable, directly supporting the portfolio’s compounding advocacy aim.
 - **Parent link:** Enables Portfolio outcome [bvssh/2026/portfolio/compounding-advocacy-via-themes.md](bvssh/2026/portfolio/compounding-advocacy-via-themes.md).

## 4) Desired Outcome (BVSSH)
- **Primary dimensions:** Sooner, Better
- **Sooner:** Orientation time via synthesis entry drops toward <10 minutes.
- **Better:** Clear, current synthesis pages expose evolving hypotheses and patterns.
- **Secondary:** Value, Safer, Happier
- **Value:** Readers reuse artifacts faster; synthesis directs adaptation paths.
- **Safer:** Regular curation prevents drift and chaos in growing streams.
- **Happier:** Practice feels intentional and cumulative, reducing re-explanation.

## 5) Outcome Hypothesis
- **Hypothesis:** Publishing one lightweight synthesis artifact per active theme each quarter — and linking it bidirectionally with the theme trail and constituent artifacts — will reduce orientation time and increase reuse, because curated narratives turn scattered assets into navigable maps.

## 6) Expected Behavioral Change (observable)
- **Before:** Artifact accumulation; post-hoc synthesis, irregular; trails vary in freshness.
- **After:** Scheduled quarterly synthesis; published per active theme; bidirectional links added on publish.
- **Stops:** Relying solely on artifact lists without curation; postponing synthesis indefinitely.
- **Starts:** Calendarized synthesis sessions; publish 500–1500 word synthesis per theme; update theme trail with prominent link; add backlinks from synthesis to artifacts.

## 7) Signals & Measures (trends over targets)
- **Leading (1–3):**
  - Theme trail freshness: proportion of theme trail pages updated ≤30 days (trend: ↑).
  - Publish→backlink lag: median hours to add synthesis and artifact backlinks on publish (trend: ↓).
  - Trail gap backlog: open gaps noted on synthesis pages (trend: ↓ over time).
- **Lagging (1–3):**
  - Reader time-to-orientation from synthesis entry (median minutes) trending ↓ toward <10.
  - Reuse events citing synthesis as starting point (trend: ↑).
  - Reversals/redo due to misorientation (self-reported trend: ↓).

### Signal Cascading
- Program leading signals (trail freshness, publish→backlink lag, gap backlog) are expected to drive Portfolio lagging signals in [bvssh/2026/portfolio/compounding-advocacy-via-themes.md](bvssh/2026/portfolio/compounding-advocacy-via-themes.md): orientation median trending ↓ and reuse events trending ↑.

## 8) Constraints & Guardrails
- **Constraints:** Keep synthesis lightweight (500–1500 words); avoid bureaucratic formats; limit active themes to **2–3**; defer synthesis if a theme has <3 artifacts.
- **Trade-offs:** Balance creation vs. curation; allocate ~2–4 hours/quarter per active theme.
- **Guardrails:** Bidirectional linking required; record rationale for theme changes in kb; prefer trend signals over fixed targets; revise synthesis structure only quarterly.

## 9) Review & Learning Cadence
- **Monthly check-in:** Confirm trail freshness, capture friction, update backlog of gaps.
- **Quarterly synthesis:** Publish per active theme; update trail; decide theme evolution.
- **Participants:** Self; optionally 1–2 practitioners for orientation spot-check.
- **Decision enabled:** Keep/adjust themes, confirm cadence, prioritize filling trail gaps.

## 10) Reflection (post-outcome)
- **Capture:** Surprises; validated/invalidated assumptions; orientation and reuse trends; changes to synthesis structure for next quarter.

## Quarterly Synthesis Structure
1. **Theme intent:** Brief purpose and current focus (1 paragraph).
2. **Artifacts trail:** Ordered list with single-line summaries and links.
3. **Emerging patterns:** Hypotheses/patterns connecting artifacts.
4. **Gaps & next:** Missing pieces; concrete next steps.
5. **Orientation guide:** "Start here" paths by reader intent.

## Active Themes (initial)
- **Coherence** (initial); expand to **2–3** total as needed.

## Orientation Time Baseline
- **Current:** Baseline capture starts Jan 2026 via monthly spot-check sample; publish median in KB theme pages and track monthly.

## Reuse Events (definition)
- **Definition:** An artifact is referenced, adapted, or extended in a new piece; log events and add backlinks.
