# 2026 Jan–Feb Outcome Exploration
**Aligned with VRA, BVSSH, and SSH Advocacy**

---

## Option 1: VRA as Advocacy Operating System
**Level:** Team | **2026 Focus:** Uncertainty Before Solutioning

**Outcome:** Advocate at Variable Resolution Without Collapse

**Tension:** Advocacy momentum collapses when energy varies. High energy → clarity and output. Low energy → drift and revert.

**BVSSH Alignment:**
- **Better:** Explicit permission to vary resolution; low moments preserve continuity
- **Value:** Reusable model for advocates facing rhythm challenges
- **Sooner:** Reduced restart cycles; outcome log maintains momentum during gaps
- **Safer:** Lower burnout risk; sustainable multi-year practice
- **Happier:** Humane advocacy, not pressure-driven

**Hypothesis:** Codifying VRA with lightweight artefacts (outcome log, resolution dial language) lets advocates maintain direction through variable energy without guilt or clarity loss.

**Behavioral Signal:** Energy ∝ fidelity (not output quality); low-resolution work is valid.

## Option 2: Outcome Themes as Coherence Anchors
**Level:** Program | **2026 Focus:** Uncertainty Before Solutioning

**Outcome:** Advocate Themes Visible Before Synthesis Happens

**Tension:** Themes emerge only after significant work. Discovery and theme-making are decoupled, slowing reuse and confusing readers.

**BVSSH Alignment:**
- **Better:** Themes named early, shaping what gets created next
- **Value:** Others find and extend work without explanation
- **Sooner:** Faster orientation and reuse across portfolio
- **Safer:** Theme clarity prevents accidental drift
- **Happier:** Advocacy feels intentional and connected

**Hypothesis:** Naming 2–3 coherence themes before Jan starts lets each artefact declare its theme, enabling navigation by thread.

**Behavioral Signal:** New outcomes reference which theme they extend or refine.

## Recommendation

**Start with Option 2 (Themes)** in Jan: Discovery work, light, no pressure.  
**Explore Option 1 (VRA Codified)** in Feb: Document operating model after themes are visible.

Both feed 2026 hypothesis and require low initial resolution to remain valid.
