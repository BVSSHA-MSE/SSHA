# Outcome Mapping Core Rules

## Purpose
Align stakeholders on a single target outcome and produce a BVSSH-ready outcome artifact anchored to Flow Engineering's constraint-first approach.

## Core Rules
- Outcome-first: anchor everything to one meaningful outcome; reject solution-first framing.
- System framing: focus on constraints, dependencies, and observable behaviors; avoid people-problem narratives.
- Constraint focus: optimize the primary constraint, not everything.
- Hypothesis mindset: treat change as a testable hypothesis; iterate as understanding grows.
- Lightweight signals: prefer trends and directionality over rigid targets; just enough data to act.
- Scope discipline: one outcome, one value stream, one primary constraint at a time.
