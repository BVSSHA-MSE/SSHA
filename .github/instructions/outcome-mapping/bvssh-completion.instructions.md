# BVSSH Completion

## Delegation & Precedence
- Primary workflow: defer to [\.github/instructions/bvssh-outcome-facilitation.instructions.md](../bvssh/bvssh-outcome-facilitation.instructions.md).
- Prompt: use [\.github/prompts/bvssh-outcome-facilitation.prompt.md](../../prompts/bvssh-outcome-facilitation.prompt.md) to run facilitation.
- Agent persona: operate as [\.github/agents/bvssh-outcome-facilitator.agent.md](../../agents/bvssh-outcome-facilitator.agent.md).
- Scope: this file is the BVSSH section-level checklist; content generation and stakeholder flow are governed by the facilitation workflow.

## How to Use (Quick-Start)
- Run the facilitation prompt with the facilitator agent.
- Produce BVSSH sections through facilitation; validate against this checklist.
- If conflicts arise, facilitation instructions take precedence over this checklist.

## Hypothesis
Smallest credible change → expected BVSSH effect → rationale.

## Behavioral Change
Before/After and Stops/Starts; observable behaviors only.

## Signals & Measures
1–3 leading, 1–3 lagging; prefer trends to targets; lightweight and observable.

## Constraints & Guardrails
Real constraints and explicit trade-offs; no generic placeholders.

## Review Cadence
Frequency, participants, and the decision the review enables.

## Reflection
Post-outcome: surprises, validated/invalidated assumptions, what to change next time.
