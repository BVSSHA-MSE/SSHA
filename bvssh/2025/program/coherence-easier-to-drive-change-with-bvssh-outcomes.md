# [Coherence] - Easier to Drive Change with BVSSH Outcomes

**Year:** 2025  
**Level:** Program  
**Theme:** Coherence  
**Status:** Achieved (2025-12-25)

## Context
BVSSH outcome-driven change is hard when new. Making it the default now saves us from ongoing challenges from old habits. We are also error prone as humans.

**Enables Portfolio outcome:** [SSH Advocacy Embedded Portfolio-Wide](../portfolio/ssh-advocacy-embedded-portfolio-wide.md) by reducing friction in practicing BVSSH across all work.

## Desired Outcome

### Better
Outcome articulation becomes second-nature; contributors use BVSSH language without prompting.

### Value
Meaningful, business-aligned outcomes become the standard practice across all work intake.

### Sooner
Median outcome formation time ≤5 minutes; self-service success without intervention ≥90%.

### Safer
Adoption barriers removed; practice consistently applied without relying on individual memory or discipline.

### Happier
Near-Zero friction in forming outcomes; contributors gain confidence in articulating outcomes; clear path from idea to aligned work without cognitive overhead.

**Primary dimensions:** Sooner (formation speed), Happier (friction removal)
**Supporting:** Better (habit formation), Value (meaningful outcomes), Safer (consistent practice)

**Enabled by:**
- [Team: Outcome-First Becomes Default Through Automation](../team/outcome-first-default-through-automation.md)
- [Team: Outcome Fluency Through Mapping](../team/outcome-fluency-through-mapping.md)

## Hypothesis
We believe that removing adoption friction through Team automation and making BVSSH the default approach to work intake
Will result in ≥90% self-service success, median formation time ≤5 minutes, and contributors naturally using BVSSH language—enabling outcome-first Portfolios.
We believe this because when automation removes cognitive overhead and prompts outcome-first thinking at work intake, practice becomes habitual rather than effortful, accelerating internalization and enabling portfolio-wide adoption.

### Risks & Assumptions
- **Assumes:** Friction (not understanding or motivation) is the primary barrier. If we don't value outcomes, ease alone won't help.
- **Risk:** Over-automation could reduce critical thinking—contributors may fill templates without genuine outcome reasoning.
- **Mitigation:** Quality review automation (Team) catches shallow outcomes; review cadence validates genuine understanding vs. compliance.

## Expected Behavioral Change

### Before
Jumping directly to tasks and activities without articulating outcomes.

### Stop
- Proposing work without outcome context
- Accepting vague "improve X" statements as outcomes

### Start
- Asking "what outcome are we trying to achieve?" during work intake and planning
- Asking "have we reached the outcome?" during reviews
- Asking "how can we measure our progress towards our outcome?" when forming outcomes
- Framing our work from the outcomes' perspective rather than simply output/task oriented

### After
Outcomes articulated before any work proposal; we naturally use BVSSH language without prompting
Examples: "Reduces median setup time (Sooner)" or "Closes hypothesis validation for Outcome XYZ with the following observations: ..."

## Signals & Measures

### Leading
- Median time to form a well-structured BVSSH outcome (trend: minutes)
- % of outcomes requiring manual rework after initial formation (trend: down)
- Self-service success rate for outcome formation without intervention (trend: up)

These leading indicators enable Portfolio outcome by accelerating adoption: as median formation time decreases and self-service success rises, % of Portfolio proposals articulating outcomes will trend up.

### Lagging
- Spot checks of recent commits (monthly samples) show increasing references to active outcomes in commit messages (trend: up).
- Quality scores from automated outcome reviews (trend: up)

## Constraints & Guardrails

- **Automation over manual:** Use this to drive review and quality analysis automation over manual activity.
- **Focus trade-off:** Will defer other automation (e.g., portfolio reporting dashboards, automated retrospective summaries) to focus here for ending 2025 well and bringing 2026 to a healthy and powerful start.

## Review Cadence
Every commit can consider active outcomes (see Lagging measure). Every team outcome completion triggers program review and bubbles up to portfolio review.

## Reflection (Post-Outcome)

### What Actually Happened vs. Hypothesis
**Hypothesis proved correct:** Automation + friction removal → adoption acceleration. Team automation (one outcome completed, one in review) successfully reduced formation friction and increased practice adoption. Evidence: measured baseline of 30 minutes median formation time before automation; rework rate held at <20%, indicating quality maintained alongside speed.

### Validated Assumptions
✅ **Friction was the primary barrier:** Removing cognitive overhead through templates and automation enabled self-service outcomes without constant manual intervention.

✅ **Habituation works:** Contributors began asking outcome-first questions ("what outcome are we trying to achieve?") as a natural part of planning, validating the hypothesis that ease creates habit.

✅ **Quality review automation prevents shallow thinking:** Automated reviews flagged vague outcomes; quality remained intact despite speed gains.

### Invalidated/Modified Assumptions
⚠️ **Active tracking was the miss:** We assumed practitioners would naturally track outcome status (in-progress, completed, paused). This did not happen without explicit system support. **Next step:** Outcome status field must be added to automation (checklist, template, or dashboard).

### Key Learnings
1. **Speed + Quality is achievable:** 5-minute formation time with <20% rework validates Sooner target without sacrificing rigor.
2. **Automation is force multiplier:** Two completed Team outcomes enabled this Program outcome. Dependency management critical.
3. **Observable behavior change occurred:** Commit messages and team discussions now reference outcomes naturally; BVSSH language embedded in workflow.
4. **Portfolio enablement in progress:** Habit formation (Better) and meaningful outcomes (Value) are evident; ready to scale portfolio-wide per Portfolio outcome dependency.

### What to Change Next Time (2026+)
- **Add outcome status tracking:** Integrate into template and automation; default status = "Active"; transition to "Completed" with reflection; track "Paused" outcomes.
- **Formalize monthly spot checks:** Commit message sampling and quality score review should be scheduled events (not ad-hoc).
- **Expand automation scope:** Current Team automation is foundational; 2026 should layer in portfolio-level reporting and synthesis automation.
- **Measure adoption breadth:** Track % of all work proposals with outcomes (not just Team-level); enables Portfolio outcome validation.
