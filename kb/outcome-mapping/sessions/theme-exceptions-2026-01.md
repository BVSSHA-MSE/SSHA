# Theme Exceptions Log — January 2026
**Purpose:** Capture artifacts that don't fit the standard `[Theme] - [Title]` pattern or belong to a different theme. Review weekly to surface theme evolution needs.

---

## Format
Each entry:
- **Artifact:** Name/link
- **Pattern:** Does it use `[Theme] -`? (yes/no)
- **Rationale:** Why doesn't it fit [Coherence] or the pattern?
- **Proposed Theme:** If it belongs elsewhere, which theme?
- **Date Logged:** 
- **Resolution:** [Post-resolution notes]

## Summary & Learning

[Post-sprint reflection: Did any exceptions reveal theme evolution needs? Should we adjust theme definitions? Any artifacts that suggest a new theme should emerge? Captured here by Week 2 end.]
