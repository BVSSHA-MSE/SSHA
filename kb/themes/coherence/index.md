# Coherence Theme Trail

**Purpose:** Central entry point for Coherence theme artifacts. Organize and navigate artifacts exploring foundational SSH principles, outcome design thinking, and coherence mechanisms enabling compounding advocacy.

**Active:** 2025–2026  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-25

## Theme Intent

**Coherence:** Foundational SSH principles, outcome design thinking, and coherence mechanisms that enable compounding advocacy.

**Scope & Core Concepts:**
- SSH advocacy outcome frame (Better, Value, Sooner, Safer, Happier)
- Outcome design workflows and decision-making
- Systems thinking and coherence patterns in advocacy
- Reuse and compounding across advocacy work
- Trail curation and synthesis (theme maps, orientation guides)
- Portfolio governance and outcome-first practices

**Why it matters:** When artifacts cohere around explicit principles and reuse pathways, practitioners spend less time orienting and more time contributing. Compounding effects compound.

## Artifacts by Level

### Portfolio
Foundation-level outcomes defining system-wide coherence intent and measurement.

- [Compounding Advocacy via Themes](../../../bvssh/2026/portfolio/coherence-compounding-advocacy-via-themes.md) — Declare theme-based structure; enable reuse and compounding via observable theme trails (2026).
- [SSH Advocacy Embedded Portfolio-Wide](../../../bvssh/2025/portfolio/coherence-ssh-advocacy-embedded-portfolio-wide.md) — Practice SSH principles across all work; establish outcome-first as a portfolio habit (2025).

### Program
Cadence and synthesis outcomes enabling regular coherence review and pattern visibility.

- [Quarterly Theme Synthesis Published](../../../bvssh/2026/program/coherence-quarterly-theme-synthesis-published.md) — Publish quarterly synthesis; expose patterns, hypotheses, and learnings across theme artifacts (2026).
- [Easier to Drive Change with BVSSH Outcomes](../../../bvssh/2025/program/coherence-easier-to-drive-change-with-bvssh-outcomes.md) — Make outcome-first the default behavior; reduce friction for BVSSH adoption (2025).

### Team
Operationalization outcomes enabling consistent theme labeling and automation.

- [Theme-Labeled Titles by Default](../../../bvssh/2026/team/coherence-theme-labeled-titles-by-default.md) — Enforce `[Coherence] - [Title]` pattern at artifact creation; eliminate post-hoc tagging (2026, Weeks 1–2).

- [Outcome-First Becomes Default Through Automation](../../../bvssh/2025/team/coherence-outcome-first-default-through-automation.md) — Scaffold outcome creation; automate quality checks; lower friction for BVSSH practice (2025).
- [Outcome Fluency Through Mapping](../../../bvssh/2025/team/coherence-outcome-fluency-through-mapping.md) — Lightweight pre-facilitation mapping step; raise outcome quality; prevent solution-first thinking (2025).

## Orientation Guide

### New to Coherence? Start Here
1. **What is coherence in SSH advocacy?**  
   Read: [Compounding Advocacy via Themes](../../../bvssh/2026/portfolio/coherence-compounding-advocacy-via-themes.md) (Portfolio outcome; 5 min read)

2. **How do I apply this in my work?**  
   Read: [Outcome-First Becomes Default Through Automation](../../../bvssh/2025/team/coherence-outcome-first-default-through-automation.md) (Team outcome; shows automation approach; 8 min read)

3. **How do I tag my artifacts?**  
   Use: [Artifact Template](artifact-template.md) and [Theme Selection Guidance](.github/instructions/copilot/theme-selection.instructions.md) (5 min decision tree)

4. **I wrote an artifact. Now what?**  
   Follow: Universal Artifact Theming steps 1–10; pre-publish checklist confirms theme fit (10 min)

### Deepening Understanding
- **Explore outcome design:** Read all Team outcomes (2025); understand nine-step structure and BVSSH dimensions
- **Understand reuse patterns:** Read Program outcome on Quarterly Synthesis; see how coherence enables pattern recognition
- **Track progress:** Check exceptions log weekly; join Outcome 1 execution (Jan 1) for live operationalization

### FAQ

**Q: Does every artifact need a theme?**  
A: No. Finished, published advocacy artifacts → yes. Working documents, agent notes, reference materials → no. Unclear? Log in exceptions log; clarify in weekly review.

**Q: What if my artifact doesn't fit Coherence?**  
A: Log in exceptions log with rationale. If pattern emerges (3+ exceptions), propose new theme. For now, either assign with exception note or keep standalone.

**Q: How is this different from just organizing by topic?**  
A: Coherence is outcome-first. Artifacts explore how foundation principles (SSH) enable compounding work. Topic organization is post-hoc; coherence is built-in from creation.

**Q: When do backlinks appear?**  
A: On publish, automation detects `[Coherence] -` prefix and suggests backlink. After review/approval, backlink appends to this trail within 24 hours.

## Emerging Patterns

### Hypothesis Evolution
- **2025:** Outcome-first becomes default via automation and fluency-building.
- **2026:** Coherence emerges as the organizing principle; reuse multiplies via themed trails.
- **Emerging:** Theme-based navigation reduces orientation time and enables faster pattern recognition for new practitioners.

### Reuse Events
- Outcomes 2025 → scaffolded outcomes 2026 (outcome fluency enables theme-first)
- Outcome 1 (Titles by Default) → enables Outcome 2 (Backlinks Automated) → enables Program synthesis
- Synthesis patterns → inform future theme evolution and artifact prioritization

### Leading Signals
- ✅ Template adoption: 100% (2026 outcomes use template)
- ⏳ Theme tag coverage: Target ≥95% by Jan 14 (Outcome 1)
- ⏳ Publish→backlink lag: Target <24h (Outcome 2)

## Gaps & Next Steps

### Open Questions
- **New themes:** Will 3+ exceptions clusters suggest additional themes (e.g., Governance, Policy, Domain-Specific)? Decision point: Q1 2026 quarterly review.
- **Multi-theme artifacts:** How to handle artifacts that span multiple themes? Current: assign primary, link others in "Related." Refine if pattern emerges.
- **Reference vs. advocacy:** How to distinguish reference materials (docs/, kb/asciidoctor/ruby-api.md) from advocacy artifacts? Decision: clarify GROUND_RULES.md by Jan 15.

### Upcoming Milestones
| Date | Outcome | Success Criteria |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Jan 14 | Theme-Labeled Titles by Default (Outcome 1) | ≥95% coverage; 0 omissions |
| Jan 28 | Theme Trail Backlinks Automated (Outcome 2) | ≥90% auto-generation; <24h lag |
| Mar 31 | Quarterly Theme Synthesis Published (Program) | First synthesis published; trail current & linked |

## How to Use This Trail

### For Readers
- **Orientation:** Start with Portfolio outcomes (why coherence matters), then Team outcomes (how to practice)
- **Pattern hunting:** Scan artifact list; notice which outcomes enable downstream outcomes
- **Learning:** Use trail as entry point; follow "Related Artifacts" links within each artifact for deeper dives

### For Contributors
- **Before publishing:** Check this trail; confirm your artifact belongs (use decision tree)
- **Adding to trail:** Tag with `[Coherence] -` prefix; automation appends backlink within 24h (starting Week 3 2026)
- **Iterating:** If you discover a gap or pattern, log in exceptions log; surfaces in weekly review

### For Program Review
- **Quarterly synthesis:** Use this trail as the source list; update patterns section post-synthesis
- **Coverage tracking:** Check trailing artifacts (published ≤30 days); aim for 100% visibility
- **Evolution signals:** Review exceptions log; propose new themes if 3+ clusters emerge
